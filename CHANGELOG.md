### PRD-024 Part 6 — Multi-Stream Chat: `useChat` Cleanup — 2026-04-29

Closes out PRD-024's cleanup intent. **Three of four P6 requirements were already satisfied as side-effects of Parts 2–5** (no streaming refs in `useChat`, single-source SSE parsing, no dead legacy code). Part 6 ships the remaining piece — the LOC ceiling on `useChat` (P6.R4: under 200 LOC) — by decomposing the monolithic hook into two focused sub-hooks plus a thin composer. Also closes the `countActiveStreams` predicate-duplication carry-over from Part 3 + Part 5 audits.

- **PRD-024 P6.R1 — `useChat` is concise.** ✅ **Already done in Part 2.** All streaming refs, abort controllers, SSE loops, and state machines were removed when the hook migrated to `lib/streaming`. The remaining `use-chat.ts` was just message-list management + a thin streaming-passthrough layer.
- **PRD-024 P6.R2 — SSE parsing in one place.** ✅ **Already done in Part 1 Increment 1.** `parseSSEChunk`, `stripFollowUpBlock`, and the `<!--follow-ups:...-->` regex live in `lib/utils/chat-helpers.ts` only. Both the streaming module's `runStream` and the server-side `chat-stream-service.ts` import from this single source.
- **PRD-024 P6.R3 — Dead legacy code removed.** ✅ **Already done in Part 2's rewrite.** No `abortControllerRef`, `streamingContentRef`, `assistantMessageIdRef`, or legacy SSE references remained in `use-chat.ts` post-Part-2. Part 6's audit found and removed one additional dead export — `listSlices` from `streaming-store.ts`, orphaned by Increment 2's predicate consolidation.
- **PRD-024 P6.R4 — Under 200 LOC.** Achieved via decomposition. `lib/hooks/use-chat.ts` shrinks from **492 LOC** (post-Part-5) to **128 LOC** — a 74% reduction, well under the ceiling. The displaced logic moves to two new focused sub-hooks: `useConversationMessages` (196 LOC, message-list role) and `useChatStreaming` (286 LOC, streaming subscription + delegates). Each sub-hook has one clear concern; the composer is pure wiring.
- **Architectural choice — split along the two natural concerns.** `useChat` post-Part-5 already did two distinct things: message-list management (load, paginate, append-via-fold, clear, 404 handling) and streaming subscription + actions (slice read, send/cancel/retry, fold, clear-unseen, pending fallback). Part 6 makes the split explicit. The hooks are coupled at exactly two points — `setMessages` (passed from `useConversationMessages` to `useChatStreaming` for optimistic adds, trim, fold) and `messages` (for retryLastMessage's last-user lookup). Two-prop coupling, well-defined seam, composer wires them.
- **Architectural choice — predicate consolidation in `streaming-store.ts`.** Three Part audits flagged the `slice.teamId === teamId && slice.streamState === "streaming"` predicate duplication between `streaming-actions.ts`'s `countActiveStreams` and `streaming-hooks.ts`'s `computeActiveStreamIds`. Part 6 owns the cleanup. New exports in `streaming-store.ts`: `isStreamingForTeam(teamId)` and `hasUnseenCompletionForTeam(teamId)` predicate factories (each baking the team filter into the predicate), plus `findSlicesWhere(predicate)` generic iteration+filter helper. Both consumers now compose these — the predicate logic lives in exactly one source file. `stableFilteredIds` (in `streaming-hooks.ts`) is now truly generic over any predicate; the team-filter responsibility moved up into the predicates.
- **Increment 1 — Decompose `useChat`.** Created `lib/hooks/use-conversation-messages.ts` (196 LOC) — owns `messages` / `isLoadingMessages` / `hasMoreMessages` / `isConversationNotFound` state, the load-messages effect with the Gap P9 skip-refetch guard intact, `messagesRef` / `prevConversationIdRef`, `fetchMoreMessages`, `clearMessages`, exposes `setMessages` for the streaming hook. Created `lib/hooks/use-chat-streaming.ts` (286 LOC) — owns `pendingConversationId` state + auto-clear effect + `subscriptionIdRef` mirroring (post-Part-2-audit pattern), `useStreamingSlice` subscription, six derived passthrough fields, `sendMessage` / `cancelStream` / `retryLastMessage` callbacks, the fold `useLayoutEffect` (P2.R7 no-flicker), and the clear-unseen `useLayoutEffect` (P4.R2 + Part-4-audit). Rewrote `lib/hooks/use-chat.ts` (128 LOC) — pure composition: instantiates both sub-hooks, threads `messages` + `setMessages` between them, returns the combined `UseChatReturn` shape. The `UseChatOptions` and `UseChatReturn` interfaces are byte-identical to pre-Part-6 (P2.R5 surface preserved); `chat-area`, `chat-input`, `message-thread`, `chat-page-content` compile and run unchanged. Sub-hooks are not re-exported from any barrel — only the composer (`useChat`) imports them.
- **Increment 2 — Streaming-store predicate consolidation.** Added three exports to `streaming-store.ts`: `isStreamingForTeam(teamId)` predicate factory, `hasUnseenCompletionForTeam(teamId)` predicate factory (added for symmetry — both predicates are now complete filters with team baked in), and `findSlicesWhere(predicate)` generic iteration+filter helper. Replaced inline `countActiveStreams` body in `streaming-actions.ts` with a one-liner using the new helpers (`findSlicesWhere(isStreamingForTeam(teamId)).length`). Refactored `stableFilteredIds` in `streaming-hooks.ts` to be generic over predicates — the team-filter responsibility is now in the predicate factories, not inside `stableFilteredIds` itself. Both `useActiveStreamIds` and `useUnseenCompletionIds` compose the new factories.
- **Increment 3 — End-of-part audit.** Audit produced one real fix: `listSlices` (in `streaming-store.ts`) was now dead — its only two consumers (`countActiveStreams` and `stableFilteredIds`) had both been refactored to use `findSlicesWhere` instead. Per CLAUDE.md "Delete dead code immediately"; removed. Verified single-source-of-truth: `slice.teamId === teamId && slice.streamState === "streaming"` and `slice.teamId === teamId && slice.hasUnseenCompletion` each appear in exactly one source file (`streaming-store.ts`); the follow-up regex appears in exactly one source file (`chat-helpers.ts`); each `streaming-store.ts` export has at least one consumer. Other audit checks ran clean: SRP (each hook does one thing — message list, streaming, or composition; each store helper owns one concept), DRY (predicate consolidation closed; `LOG_PREFIX = "[useChat]"` is duplicated across the two sub-hooks but matches the project pattern of per-file log prefixes from `streaming-actions.ts`), design tokens (no UI changes), logging (preserves the `[useChat]` prefix on grep-relevant lines), convention (kebab-case files, `useX` hook names, `string \| null` prop shape, JSDoc on the composer's preserved API surface).
- **Behavioural impact this PR.** Zero. The composer's `UseChatReturn` shape is byte-identical to pre-Part-6; chat-surface components consume it unchanged. All Parts 1–5 behaviors preserved verbatim — send / abort / retry / fresh-chat / cross-conversation switch / fold (flicker-free) / unseen-clear / per-workspace cap / cross-page survival / sidebar indicators / footer text / AppSidebar dot.
- **Net code change.** `lib/hooks/use-chat.ts`: 492 → 128 LOC (−364). `lib/hooks/use-conversation-messages.ts`: 0 → 196 LOC (+196). `lib/hooks/use-chat-streaming.ts`: 0 → 286 LOC (+286). `lib/streaming/streaming-store.ts`: 100 → 144 LOC (+44 for predicate factories + helper, −5 for `listSlices` removal = net +39). `lib/streaming/streaming-actions.ts`: 350 → 342 LOC (−8 from inline-body to one-liner). `lib/streaming/streaming-hooks.ts`: 158 → 154 LOC (−4 from generic stableFilteredIds). Net: +149 LOC across the codebase, almost entirely **structural separation overhead** (imports, prop interfaces, return-shape forwarding) — the actual behavioural code shrunk.
- **Carry-overs closed.** Part 3 audit's `countActiveStreams` predicate-duplication target ✅. Part 5 audit's re-flag of the same ✅. Both closed by Increment 2's consolidation.
- **Carry-over deferred.** Dot-rendering pattern duplication between `conversation-item.tsx` (Part 4) and `app-sidebar.tsx` (Part 5) — different positioning + different token systems (`bg-primary` vs. `bg-[var(--brand-primary)]`); extraction would require larger token-system unification work outside Part 6's scope. **Re-flagged for future cleanup if a third dot surface lands.** No PRD-024 part owns this.
- **Forward-compat to Part 7.** Final part is documentation. Part 7 will: write the dedicated streaming-context section in `ARCHITECTURE.md` (replacing Part 5's prefiguring placeholder), add the Key Design Decisions entry for the streaming-context choice, walk the file map against the actual filesystem (Part 7 P7.R2 mandates zero diff), and reconcile the PRD-023 P4 deferral references. No code work.

### PRD-024 Part 5 — Multi-Stream Chat: Cross-Page Stream Survival — 2026-04-29

**Four of five P5 requirements were already structurally satisfied by Parts 1–4.** Part 5 ships the only piece that needed new code (the AppSidebar Chat icon dot — P5.R2) and hardens one auth lifecycle path that wasn't yet covered by the explicit `signOut` cleanup.

- **PRD-024 P5.R1 — Streams survive in-app navigation.** ✅ **Already structural** from Part 1's design. The streaming module is a module-level singleton — its `Map<conversationId, slice>`, listener `Set`, and `AbortController` map all live as module exports independent of the React tree. Navigating from `/chat` to `/dashboard` unmounts `ChatPageContent` and `useChat`, but the module-level state persists; the SSE loop in `runStream` is a detached promise with no React-lifecycle observation. Streams continue running; their slices accumulate deltas; on return to `/chat`, the new `useChat` instance subscribes to the slice and reads its current state. No code change in this part.
- **PRD-024 P5.R2 — AppSidebar Chat icon reflects global streaming state.** Added a brand-accent indicator dot overlay on the Chat nav icon in `components/layout/app-sidebar.tsx`. Pulsating when `useActiveStreamCount(teamId) > 0`; solid when no streams but `useHasAnyUnseenCompletion(teamId)` is true; no dot otherwise. Visible on every authenticated page (chat and non-chat). Both Part 1 hooks consumed; no new module API needed. Aria-label on the Chat Link extended to *"Chat, response generating"* / *"Chat, new unread response"* / *"Chat"* — same cohesive-decoration pattern Part 4 established for `conversation-item`. Token-only styling (`var(--brand-primary)`, `var(--surface-page)`, `animate-pulse`) matching the file's existing convention.
- **PRD-024 P5.R3 — Hard refresh / sign-out cancels client streams.** ✅ **Already implemented.** Hard refresh kills the JS bundle entirely; the streaming module reinitializes empty. Sign-out's `clearAllStreams` (Part 1 Increment 3) aborts every controller and drops every slice. Server may still complete and persist the stream in flight; the client just re-fetches on next load. No code change.
- **PRD-024 P5.R4 — No leak across users on the same browser.** Hardened. Pre-existing: `signOut` clears streams + workspace cookie + activeTeamId. Part 5 adds the same cleanup to the `onAuthStateChange` listener's session-null branch — covers token expiry, multi-tab sign-out, and server-side revocation, where the SDK fires `onAuthStateChange` with `session=null` without going through this tab's `signOut` function. Audit-time fix: previously the `else` branch only cleared `canCreateTeam`; Part 5's audit pass found that the workspace cookie and `activeTeamId` were also leaking through session-expiry transitions and applied the full mirror of `signOut`'s cleanup.
- **PRD-024 P5.R5 — Workspace switch isolates UI state without aborting streams.** ✅ **Already structural.** Slices carry `teamId` (Part 1's `ConversationStreamSlice` shape). Every public hook filters by `teamId`. Switching workspaces changes which `teamId` callers pass; cross-workspace slices retain their state but produce zero UI in the wrong workspace; the SSE loop is `teamId`-agnostic and runs to completion regardless. No code change.
- **Increment 1 — AppSidebar dot + auth-state-change hardening.** `app-sidebar.tsx` (+25 LOC): subscribes to `useActiveStreamCount` and `useHasAnyUnseenCompletion` at the top of `SidebarContent` with `teamId` from `useAuth().activeTeamId`. Wraps the icon in a `relative flex shrink-0` span so the dot can be absolutely positioned at `-top-0.5 -right-0.5`. `ring-2 ring-[var(--surface-page)]` for icon-vs-dot contrast. Tokens match the file's existing `var(--brand-primary)` convention (project's custom system, distinct from shadcn's `bg-primary` used in `conversation-item.tsx`; cross-file token-system inconsistency is a pre-existing project pattern). `auth-provider.tsx` (+8 LOC): one defensive `clearAllStreams()` call in the `onAuthStateChange` listener's session-null branch.
- **Increment 2 — End-of-part audit + verification.** Audit produced one real fix: the `onAuthStateChange` else branch was missing `clearActiveTeamCookie()` and `setActiveTeamId(null)` — pre-existing partial cleanup that allowed the workspace cookie and team-id state to leak across session-null transitions. Pre-Part 5, only `signOut` did the full cleanup; the auth-state listener did only `setCanCreateTeam(false)`. P5.R4's principle of "no state from user A visible to user B" applies to all session-bound state, not just streams. Fix: mirror `signOut`'s full cleanup chain (`clearActiveTeamCookie` + `clearAllStreams` + `setActiveTeamId(null)` + `setCanCreateTeam(false)`) in the else branch. Other audit checks ran clean: SRP (dot rendering co-located with Chat nav item; cleanup co-located in the auth listener), DRY (dot rendering pattern now used in two places — `conversation-item.tsx` and `app-sidebar.tsx`; flagged for extraction follow-up if a third surface lands; `countActiveStreams` carry-over from Part 3 still flagged for Part 6), design tokens (zero hardcoded colors / spacing), logging (existing module logs cover the mutations), dead code (no orphan imports), convention (kebab-case files, JSDoc on the hardening rationale, A11y attrs).
- **Behavioural impact this PR.** Pulsating brand-accent dot on the Chat nav icon while any stream runs in the current workspace, visible on every authenticated page. Dot transitions to solid when no streams remain but unseen completions exist; clears when both conditions are false. Sign-out, token expiry, multi-tab sign-out, and server revocation all clear the streaming store + workspace cookie + activeTeamId — no inheritance of state across user sessions on the same browser. Cross-page survival is automatic via the module-level streaming store from Part 1.
- **Net code change.** `app-sidebar.tsx` +25 LOC; `auth-provider.tsx` +5 LOC (3 new function calls + comment expansion). Total: ~30 LOC of new logic, 100% UX/safety hardening. No DB schema, API route, or service-layer changes.
- **Three-tier indicator system, complete.** After Parts 4 and 5: per-conversation dots in `/chat` (entry-level), aggregate footer text in `/chat` (workspace-level), AppSidebar Chat icon dot (global / off-chat). Same lifecycle (always-set + consumer-clears), same brand-accent token, same a11y pattern (decorative dot + cohesive label on parent), same workspace filtering. The user is never unaware that streams are running or that responses are pending — regardless of which page they're on.
- **Forward-compat to Parts 6–7.** Part 6 (cleanup) still owns the `countActiveStreams` predicate-duplication target flagged since Part 3. Part 7 (docs) gets the dedicated streaming-context section in ARCHITECTURE.md. Backlog items remain explicitly out of scope: cancel-all from the global surface, push notifications, server-side stream resume on hard refresh, mobile-tailored UX (the AppSidebar Chat icon dot is desktop-first; the mobile hamburger trigger doesn't yet carry the indicator — flagged but deferred per the PRD's explicit backlog entry "Mobile-specific UX").

### PRD-024 Part 4 — Multi-Stream Chat: Sidebar Streaming Indicators — 2026-04-29

The slice's `hasUnseenCompletion` field, designed in Part 1 specifically for this purpose, finally gets its lifecycle wired. Three indicator surfaces inside the conversations sidebar — per-conversation pulsating/solid dots, aggregate "N chats are streaming" footer text, and the navigation-time acknowledgment that clears the unseen flag — all read from the same Part 1 store via the existing `useActiveStreamCount` / `useUnseenCompletionIds` hooks plus one new symmetric hook (`useHasUnseenCompletion`).

- **PRD-024 P4.R1 — Pulsating dot for streaming conversations.** Each conversation entry in the sidebar renders a brand-accent dot when `useIsStreaming(conversation.id)` is true; `animate-pulse` provides the pulsating affordance.
- **PRD-024 P4.R2 — Solid dot for completed-but-unseen responses.** When a stream completes (or cancels with content) while the user is not viewing the conversation, the dot transitions from pulsating to solid via `slice.hasUnseenCompletion`. Same single dot element with conditional `animate-pulse` — no unmount/remount, just a class toggle.
- **PRD-024 P4.R3 — Indicators consistent across active and archived lists.** `conversation-item.tsx` is shared between both groups; the per-conversation hook subscriptions cover archived entries identically.
- **PRD-024 P4.R4 — Aggregate footer text.** Conversations sidebar gains a footer line driven by `useActiveStreamCount(teamId)`. Templated singular/plural ("Start a conversation" / "1 chat is streaming" / "N chats are streaming") so future i18n catalogs can swap each branch independently. `aria-live="polite"` for screen-reader announcement.
- **PRD-024 P4.R5 — Cohesive a11y.** The dot is decorative (`aria-hidden="true"`); the conversation entry's `aria-label` is extended to include state ("{title}, generating response" / "{title}, new unread response"). Screen readers read the entry as one logical thing instead of fragmenting title and status.
- **PRD-024 P4.R6 — Click-to-clear lifecycle.** Three independent paths converge on `markConversationViewed(id)` to clear the unseen flag idempotently: (1) `useChat`'s `useLayoutEffect` fold (in-view completion); (2) `chat-page-content.navigateToConversation` (sidebar click); (3) the `popstate` handler (browser back/forward).
- **Architectural choice — "always set, consumer clears."** The streaming module unconditionally sets `hasUnseenCompletion: true` whenever `finalMessage` is set. Three independent consumer paths clear it. No subscriber-identity tracking in the store; idempotent and self-correcting. Predicted by Part 2's forward-compat note and implemented here.
- **Architectural choice — primitive-selector hooks for per-conversation reads.** `useHasUnseenCompletion(id)` is added as a direct `useSyncExternalStore` consumer with a boolean selector. `useIsStreaming(id)` is refactored to the same shape (was previously built atop `useStreamingSlice`, which forced same-conversation re-renders on every delta). Net effect: a delta in conversation A produces zero re-renders in B's sidebar item — critical for sidebar perf with many entries.
- **Increment 1 — Module additions + lifecycle flag flip.** New `useHasUnseenCompletion(id)` hook in `streaming-hooks.ts`, re-exported via `index.ts`. `useIsStreaming` refactored to the same primitive-selector shape (3 LOC). `runStream`'s completion path and `cancelStream`'s cancelled-with-content branch now set `hasUnseenCompletion: true` alongside `finalMessage` — same `setSlice` call, atomic update. The `else` branch of `cancelStream` (no partial content) doesn't set the flag because there's nothing to view. `useChat`'s `useLayoutEffect` fold now imports and calls `markConversationViewed` alongside `markFinalMessageConsumed` — self-correcting cleanup for the in-view case.
- **Increment 2 — Per-conversation indicator on sidebar entries.** `conversation-item.tsx` subscribes to both per-conversation hooks; computes `showDot = isStreaming \|\| hasUnseenCompletion`; renders a single dot element after the pin indicator with conditional `animate-pulse`; the dot is `aria-hidden="true"`; the row's new `aria-label` carries the cohesive state announcement.
- **Increment 3 — Sidebar footer + viewed-acknowledgment wiring.** `conversation-sidebar.tsx` accepts a new `teamId: string \| null` prop and renders a footer line driven by `useActiveStreamCount(teamId)` with templated singular/plural. `chat-page-content.tsx` threads `teamId` to the sidebar (one prop) and adds `markConversationViewed(id)` calls inside `navigateToConversation` (sidebar click path) and the `popstate` handler (browser back/forward path, guarded on non-null id).
- **Increment 4 — End-of-part audit.** Audit produced two real fixes, both in the **error path** which Increment 1 didn't touch:
  - **Fix 1 — Error path violated P4.R2.** The PRD specifies the solid-dot transition for "completed, cancelled, or errored with content persisted" — three terminal states. Increment 1 wired the flag flip on completion and cancellation-with-content, but the error catch in `streaming-actions.ts` set `streamState: "error"` without setting `hasUnseenCompletion`. The server already persists the failed message with whatever content streamed (`chat-stream-service.ts` flips `status: "failed"` with `fullText`); the client wasn't reflecting this in the sidebar. Fixed: error catch now reads `slice.streamingContent` *before* clearing it, sets `hasUnseenCompletion: hadContent` — solid dot iff partial content arrived. Pure-failure with zero deltas skips the flag (nothing to view).
  - **Fix 2 — In-view error case would leak `hasUnseenCompletion=true`.** After Fix 1, errors set the flag, but `useChat`'s fold only triggers on `finalMessage` transitions — error paths never set `finalMessage`, so the fold's `markConversationViewed` call wouldn't fire. The user viewing an errored conversation would see a stale solid dot on their own sidebar entry. Fixed: split the fold into two `useLayoutEffect`s. The fold now does only its message-list job; a separate effect watches `slice.hasUnseenCompletion` and clears it whenever the user is viewing. This makes the lifecycle invariant explicit: *"if useChat is mounted on a conversation, that conversation's hasUnseenCompletion is auto-cleared"* — handles completion, cancellation, and error uniformly. Removed the now-redundant `markConversationViewed` call from the fold (the new effect owns that responsibility, SRP-clean).
  - Other audit checks ran clean: SRP (each function does one thing), DRY (only known duplication is `countActiveStreams` from Part 3 — still flagged as Part 6 cleanup target), design tokens (`bg-primary`, `animate-pulse`, `text-muted-foreground` — zero hardcoded colors / spacing), logging (existing `markConversationViewed` log fires on each clear), convention (kebab-case files, `useX` hook naming, `string \| null` prop shape, A11y attrs on dot and footer).
- **Behavioural impact this PR.** Open conversation A, send a message — pulsating dot next to A's sidebar entry; footer says "1 chat is streaming". Switch to B mid-stream — A's entry still pulses; footer unchanged. A completes while you're on B — A's pulsating dot transitions to solid; footer drops to "Start a conversation"; click A in sidebar to clear the solid dot and view the response. Run 3 streams in parallel — footer says "3 chats are streaming"; each conversation has its own pulsating dot.
- **Net code change.** `streaming-hooks.ts` +20 LOC; `streaming-actions.ts` +2 LOC (one field added to each of two existing setSlice payloads); `streaming/index.ts` +1 LOC; `lib/hooks/use-chat.ts` +3 LOC; `conversation-item.tsx` +30 LOC; `conversation-sidebar.tsx` +18 LOC; `chat-page-content.tsx` +5 LOC. Total: ~80 LOC of new logic + JSDoc + a11y attributes. No DB schema, API route, or service-layer changes.
- **Forward-compat to Parts 5–7.** Part 5's AppSidebar chat icon dot consumes `useActiveStreamCount(teamId)` and `useHasAnyUnseenCompletion(teamId)` — both Part-1 hooks, same lifecycle semantics. The "always-set + consumer-clears" pattern composes cleanly: slices retain `hasUnseenCompletion=true` while the user is off-chat; the AppSidebar dot reads it; navigating back into chat triggers the existing clear paths from this part. No coordination logic needed. Part 6 still owns the `countActiveStreams` / `computeActiveStreamIds` predicate-duplication cleanup flagged in Part 3.

### PRD-024 Part 3 — Multi-Stream Chat: Multi-Conversation Streaming — 2026-04-29

Multi-stream concurrency was already a *structural* property of the architecture after Parts 1 & 2 — per-conversation slices, per-conversation `useChat` subscriptions, per-conversation `AbortController`s, per-conversation Send-button gating. Part 3 ships the **safety rail**: a soft cap of 5 concurrent streams per user per workspace, enforced at the UI gate with a defensive runtime guard as the safety net.

- **PRD-024 P3.R1 — Per-conversation Send gating.** ✅ Already correct after Part 2 — chat-input reads `streamState` from `useChat`'s passthrough, which is now per-conversation (the slice subscription is keyed by `activeConversationId`). No code change required in this part.
- **PRD-024 P3.R2 — Parallel streams.** ✅ Already structural after Part 1 — every conversation has its own slice, its own SSE loop, its own AbortController. A user can start a slow query in conversation A, switch to B, and run both streams concurrently with no blocking. Server-side persistence routes each message to its correct conversation regardless.
- **PRD-024 P3.R3 — Concurrency cap (5).** Added `MAX_CONCURRENT_STREAMS = 5` constant in `lib/streaming/streaming-types.ts`, re-exported via the barrel. Two-layer enforcement: the **UI gate** in `chat-input.tsx` reads `useActiveStreamCount(teamId)` and disables Send + renders the locked PRD message *"Already running 5 chats — wait until one of them completes before starting another."* (templated from the constant, so cap-value drift is impossible) when at cap; the **defensive runtime guard** at the top of `startStream` (`streaming-actions.ts`) refuses to start a stream when `countActiveStreams(teamId) >= MAX_CONCURRENT_STREAMS`, emits a `console.warn` with full context, and returns silently. The defense catches any future caller that bypasses the UI gate (programmatic invocation, bug in a downstream consumer, etc.).
- **PRD-024 P3.R4 — Decoupled completion.** ✅ Already structural after Part 1 — completion writes to `slice.finalMessage` regardless of which conversation the user is currently viewing; the message is persisted to its source conversation server-side. On return, `useChat`'s message-list refetch picks it up.
- **PRD-024 P3.R5 — Per-stream cancellation.** ✅ Already structural after Part 1 — each conversation's `AbortController` is keyed in its own slot in the streaming module; `cancelStream(id)` aborts only that id's controller and writes the cancelled bubble to that slice's `finalMessage`. Other in-flight streams continue unaffected.
- **Increment 1 — Cap constant + defensive guard.** Added `MAX_CONCURRENT_STREAMS = 5` to `streaming-types.ts` with JSDoc anchoring P3.R3. Added private `countActiveStreams(teamId: string | null): number` helper in `streaming-actions.ts` (iterates `listSlices()`, filters by `slice.teamId === teamId && slice.streamState === "streaming"`, returns count). Added the cap check at the top of `startStream`'s body — runs before any slice mutation so a refused start has zero side-effects. Re-exported the constant via `lib/streaming/index.ts`.
- **Increment 2 — Wire cap into chat-input.** Added `teamId: string | null` prop to `ChatInputProps` (threaded through `chat-page-content.tsx` → `chat-area.tsx` → `chat-input.tsx`; `teamId` was already in scope at `chat-page-content.tsx:46` from `useAuth().activeTeamId`). `chat-input` now imports `useActiveStreamCount` and `MAX_CONCURRENT_STREAMS` from `@/lib/streaming`, computes `isAtCap = !isStreaming && activeStreamCount >= MAX_CONCURRENT_STREAMS` (only blocks NEW streams — when this conversation is already streaming, the user can still cancel via Stop), and gates `canSend` accordingly. The cap-blocked banner renders above the input row when `isAtCap` is true with `role="status"` + `aria-live="polite"` for screen-reader announcement, design-token-only styling (`border-border`, `bg-muted/30`, `text-muted-foreground`, `rounded-md` — matches the existing "archived unarchive bar" pattern for visual consistency by precedent).
- **Increment 3 — End-of-part audit.** Audit produced two real fixes (not just a clean-bill report):
  - **Fix 1 — `handleSend` cap-gate bug.** The Send button's `disabled={!canSend}` attribute hid the cap-blocked state visually, but pressing Enter calls `handleSend` directly through `handleKeyDown`'s `e.preventDefault()` — bypassing the button's disabled state. `handleSend` only gated on `!trimmed || isStreaming`, not on the cap. Result: at cap, Enter would clear the textarea, optimistically add the user message to `messages[]`, call `moduleStartStream`, and the streaming module's defensive guard would silently warn-and-return — the user lost their input and saw an orphan user message with no AI response. Fixed by gating `handleSend` on `capReached` (the prop's new name) and adding it to the callback's deps.
  - **Fix 2 — Starter-questions bypassed the cap entirely.** `chat-area.tsx`'s empty-state rendered `<StarterQuestions onSendMessage={onSendMessage} disabled={isStreaming} />` — no cap awareness. Clicking a starter question while at cap had the same orphaned-send symptom as Fix 1. Fixed by lifting the cap state from `chat-input.tsx` up to `chat-area.tsx`, where it's the natural orchestration seam for input concerns. Both consumers (`<ChatInput />` and `<StarterQuestions />`) now gate against one source of truth — eliminating any future bypass risk for additional input surfaces (follow-up chips, suggested-text injection, etc.).
  - **Refactor as part of Fix 2.** `chat-input.tsx`'s `teamId: string \| null` prop replaced with `capReached: boolean`. Internal `useActiveStreamCount` consumption removed — `chat-input` now receives the boolean cap state and combines it with its local `isStreaming` for the banner-show / Send-disable / Enter-gate decisions. The `MAX_CONCURRENT_STREAMS` import stays in `chat-input` because the banner message templates from it. `chat-area.tsx` now imports `useActiveStreamCount` and `MAX_CONCURRENT_STREAMS`, computes `capReached = activeStreamCount >= MAX_CONCURRENT_STREAMS`, and passes the boolean to `<ChatInput />` while gating `<StarterQuestions disabled={isStreaming || capReached} />`. The streaming module's defensive guard remains as the safety net for any future caller that bypasses the chat-area gate.
  - Other audit checks ran clean: SRP (cap state is now owned by the orchestrator; rendering components consume booleans); design tokens (zero hardcoded colours/spacing in the cap banner); logging (`startStream` cap-refusal warns with `[streaming]` prefix and `count/max` context); dead code (verified `isAtCap` references fully replaced with `capReached`; no commented-out residue); convention (UPPER_SNAKE_CASE for the constant, camelCase for booleans, JSDoc on the new prop). Known intentional duplication flagged as Part 6 cleanup target: `countActiveStreams` (non-React, in `streaming-actions.ts`) duplicates the predicate in `streaming-hooks.ts`'s `computeActiveStreamIds` (React-side derivation).
- **Behavioural impact this PR.** The user can now run up to 5 concurrent streams per workspace. Send button on a non-streaming conversation disables when count >= 5; the locked inline message appears above the input. Cancelling any stream frees a slot — Send becomes enabled again on the affected input. Cross-workspace counts are independent (a personal stream doesn't count toward a team's cap and vice versa). Switching workspaces "resets" the apparent count for the input gate (the streams continue server-side; their slices remain in the store but are filtered out by `useActiveStreamCount(teamId)`'s teamId-scoped predicate).
- **Net code change.** `lib/streaming/streaming-types.ts` +6 LOC (constant + JSDoc); `lib/streaming/streaming-actions.ts` +25 LOC (helper + guard + imports); `lib/streaming/index.ts` +1 LOC (re-export); `app/chat/_components/chat-input.tsx` +20 LOC (prop + hooks + gate + banner); `app/chat/_components/chat-area.tsx` +6 LOC (prop + destructure + pass-through); `app/chat/_components/chat-page-content.tsx` +1 LOC (prop). Total: ~60 LOC of new logic + JSDoc. No DB schema, API route, or service-layer changes.
- **Forward-compat to Parts 4–7.** Part 4's conversations-sidebar footer text *"N chats are streaming"* / *"Start a conversation"* uses `useActiveStreamCount(teamId)` — same hook this part now consumes, no new module API needed. Part 5's AppSidebar pulsing dot pulses on `useActiveStreamCount(teamId) > 0`. Part 6 will absorb the `countActiveStreams` / `computeActiveStreamIds` predicate duplication via a shared selector.

### PRD-024 Part 2 — Multi-Stream Chat: `useChat` Migration — 2026-04-29

The legacy in-hook streaming path is removed; `useChat` becomes a thin orchestrator that delegates SSE consumption to the streaming module from Part 1 and retains only its message-list role. Two long-standing UX issues are fixed as **structural side-effects** of the migration — no bug-fix code per se:

- **PRD-024 P2.R4 — UI-bleed bug eliminated.** Switching from conversation A to B mid-stream no longer renders a streaming bubble in B or appends the final assistant message to B. The chat-area's streaming view now reads from a slice keyed by the active conversation ID; switching conversations switches which slice is read, full stop. Server-side persistence was always correct; only the client's state ownership was broken.
- **PRD-024 P2.R7 — No-flicker stream completion.** When the active conversation's stream transitions streaming→idle, the swap from the live streaming bubble to the persisted assistant message happens in a single render commit. `useLayoutEffect` watches the slice's `finalMessage` field and folds it into `messages[]` synchronously after DOM mutations but **before paint** — so the user never sees an intermediate frame where neither the bubble nor the message is visible.

- **Increment 1 — `markFinalMessageConsumed` action.** Added a 12-LOC public action to `lib/streaming/streaming-actions.ts`: it atomically clears `slice.finalMessage` after the consumer (now `useChat`) has folded the message into its list. Symmetric with the existing `markConversationViewed` (Part 4 R6). Re-exported via `lib/streaming/index.ts`. No consumer wired in this increment.
- **Increment 2 — `useChat` rewrite.** `lib/hooks/use-chat.ts` rewritten end-to-end (597 → 469 LOC). Removed: six streaming `useState` declarations, three streaming refs (`abortControllerRef`, `streamingContentRef`, `assistantMessageIdRef`), the entire SSE loop body (~150 LOC), the cancellation/cancelled-bubble construction (~30 LOC), and the `parseSSEChunk` / `stripFollowUpBlock` / `parseFollowUps` imports. Added: `useStreamingSlice(subscriptionId)` subscription, six derived passthrough fields (`streamState`, `streamingContent`, `statusText`, `latestSources`, `latestFollowUps`, `error`), and a `useLayoutEffect` that folds `slice.finalMessage` into `messages[]` and calls `markFinalMessageConsumed` to acknowledge consumption. `sendMessage` now generates the user-message UUID and the conversation UUID (Gap P9 preserved), adds the optimistic user message, then delegates the SSE work to `moduleStartStream`. `cancelStream` and `retryLastMessage` similarly delegate. The `UseChatReturn` interface is **byte-identical** to the pre-PRD shape — chat-surface components (`chat-area.tsx`, `chat-input.tsx`, `message-thread.tsx`, `streaming-message.tsx`) compile and render unchanged (P2.R5).
- **Increment 2 — `UseChatOptions` gains `teamId`.** New required option, threaded through to `moduleStartStream` so each slice carries its workspace tag for Part 5's cross-workspace isolation (P5.R5). The single caller — `app/chat/_components/chat-page-content.tsx` — passes `teamId` from the existing `useAuth().activeTeamId`. One-line addition; no behavioral change.
- **Increment 2 — Fresh-send subscription fallback (refinement vs. TRD spec).** The TRD's spec'd `useChat` would have a 50–200ms window during a fresh send where `useStreamingSlice(null)` returned null and the streaming bubble didn't appear until the parent's `onConversationCreated` propagated the new UUID through props. Implementation adds a `pendingConversationId` state that holds the in-flight UUID synchronously after `sendMessage` runs, so the slice subscription kicks in immediately. Auto-cleared by an effect once the prop catches up (`conversationId !== null`). Preserves legacy UX parity; the `cancelStream` callback also reads from a paired `pendingConversationIdRef` so its identity stays stable across pending-state changes.
- **Increment 3 — End-of-part audit.** Audit pass ran clean: SRP (each function does one thing — message list ownership, with streaming subscription as a means); DRY (no duplicated state machinery, SSE parsing, or abort handling — all live in `lib/streaming/`; the follow-up regex still appears in exactly one source file); logging (entry logs preserved with `[useChat]` prefix on `sendMessage` / `cancelStream` / `retryLastMessage` / `fetchMoreMessages` / load-messages effect; the `useLayoutEffect` is a render-time hook, not a service function, so no log expected); dead code (verified zero references to `abortControllerRef` / `assistantMessageIdRef` / `streamingContentRef` / `parseSSEChunk` / `stripFollowUpBlock` in `use-chat.ts` via repo-wide grep); convention (kebab-case file, named exports, interfaces, import order: React → @/lib/streaming → @/lib/types). `npx tsc --noEmit` passes clean.
- **Behavioural impact this PR.** Visible on `/chat`: the bleed bug is gone; stream completions no longer flicker; chat-input still gates Send by per-instance `streamState` (Part 3 will change this rule to per-conversation); abort and retry behave identically. Net code change: −128 LOC in `use-chat.ts`, +12 LOC in `streaming-actions.ts`, +1 LOC in `chat-page-content.tsx`, +1 LOC in `streaming/index.ts`. No DB schema, API route, or chat-surface component changes.
- **LOC note.** The TRD's "under 250 LOC" was aspirational; actual is 469. The remaining bulk is the `UseChatReturn` JSDoc (kept verbatim for the consumer-facing contract per P2.R5), the load-messages effect (~70 LOC, structurally unchanged), and refs/effects scaffolding. **PRD-024 P6.R4's "under 200 LOC" target lands in Part 6**, which will revisit the cleanup pass — most of P6.R1–R4 is already met as a side-effect of this increment (no streaming internals, no dead refs, single-source SSE parsing).
- **Forward-compat to Parts 3–7.** Part 3's per-conversation Send-button gating: chat-input already reads `streamState` from `useChat`'s passthrough — after this part, that's per-conversation. Zero `useChat` change needed. Part 3's concurrency cap: `useActiveStreamCount(teamId)` from Part 1 wires directly into `chat-input.tsx`. Part 4's `hasUnseenCompletion` policy: `useChat`'s fold acts as the "user is viewing" signal — the Part 4 decision (set the flag at completion if no chat-area is mounted) becomes a one-line addition in `streaming-actions.ts`'s completion path. Part 6's cleanup: most of P6.R1–R4 satisfied by this increment; Part 6 only needs final size reduction and docs.

### PRD-024 Part 1 — Multi-Stream Chat: Streaming Context Foundation — 2026-04-29

Scaffolding pass. The `lib/streaming/` module is built end-to-end (types, store, SSE loop, hooks, sign-out teardown) but no consumer wires it yet — `useChat` continues to own the legacy in-hook streaming path so chat behavior on `/chat` is unchanged. Part 2 will migrate consumers.

- **Increment 1 — SSE utility extraction.** Moved `parseSSEChunk` (40 LOC), `stripFollowUpBlock` (6 LOC), the two follow-up regex constants, and the `SSEEvent` interface from `lib/hooks/use-chat.ts` to `lib/utils/chat-helpers.ts`. Pure refactor — call sites unchanged. Pre-empts PRD-024 Part 6's "single source of truth for SSE/follow-up parsing" goal so the new streaming module's SSE loop and the legacy `useChat` import the same helpers (no transient duplicate). `use-chat.ts` shrank from 661 → 597 LOC; `chat-helpers.ts` grew from 92 → 168 LOC.
- **Increment 2 — Streaming module.** Created `lib/streaming/` (5 files, 605 LOC):
  - `streaming-types.ts` (60) — `ConversationStreamSlice` carrying every field future parts need (`teamId` for Part 5 workspace filtering, `hasUnseenCompletion` for Part 4 solid dot, `finalMessage` for Part 2's no-flicker handoff per P2.R7); `StartStreamArgs`; `IDLE_SLICE_DEFAULTS`.
  - `streaming-store.ts` (95) — module-level `Map<conversationId, slice>` + listener `Set` + `AbortController` map; framework-agnostic `subscribe`/`getSlice`/`setSlice`/`deleteSlice`/`listSlices`/`*AbortController`/`clearAll`. Broadcast-notify; subscribers' `getSnapshot()` returns stable refs for unchanged keys, so React's `useSyncExternalStore` bails out of re-renders for slices that didn't change (P1.R2 selective re-render).
  - `streaming-actions.ts` (289) — `startStream` (full SSE loop: fetches `/api/chat/send`, captures `X-Assistant-Message-Id` header, fires `onConversationCreated` per Gap P9, parses SSE events, accumulates content/sources/follow-ups, hands the final `Message` to the slice in the same `setSlice` call that flips `streamState` to `idle` — atomic transition that Part 2 will exploit for P2.R7), `cancelStream` (preserves partial content as a cancelled bubble — Gap E14 parity), `markConversationViewed` (Part 4 R6 hook for clearing the unseen-completion flag), `clearAllStreams` (Part 5 R4 sign-out teardown — aborts every in-flight controller, drops every slice, notifies). `LOG_PREFIX = "[streaming]"` on every entry/exit/error log.
  - `streaming-hooks.ts` (133) — `'use client'`. Six `useSyncExternalStore`-backed hooks: `useStreamingSlice(id)` (single-conversation), `useIsStreaming(id)`, plus four aggregate hooks workspace-filtered by `teamId` — `useActiveStreamIds`, `useActiveStreamCount`, `useUnseenCompletionIds`, `useHasAnyUnseenCompletion`. Aggregate hooks cache results by `teamId` and return the same array reference when content is unchanged; without this the aggregate `getSnapshot` would defeat React's bailout and force every subscriber to re-render on every notify.
  - `index.ts` (28) — barrel; the only public import path is `@/lib/streaming`.
- **Increment 3 — Sign-out teardown wiring.** One-line addition in `components/providers/auth-provider.tsx`: `clearAllStreams()` is called inside `signOut` immediately after `clearActiveTeamCookie()` and before the user/team state reset. Every in-flight `AbortController` is aborted, every slice is dropped, listeners are notified — by the time the user lands on `/login`, the store is empty. Forward-satisfies Part 5 R4 ("streams do not leak across users on the same browser") in a single line.
- **End-of-part audit.** `npx tsc --noEmit` passes clean. SRP: each `lib/streaming/*.ts` file owns one concern (types, store, actions, hooks, barrel). DRY: `parseSSEChunk` / `stripFollowUpBlock` / follow-up regexes exist in exactly one source file (`chat-helpers.ts`) — verified via repo-wide grep. Logging: `[streaming]` prefix on every action's entry/exit/error path. Dead code: legacy inline definitions in `use-chat.ts` deleted (not commented). Convention: kebab-case files, named exports only, interfaces over types for object shapes, import order follows project rule (React → third-party → internal).
- **Behavioural impact this PR:** none on `/chat` — legacy `useChat` path still owns the SSE loop and message list. Sign-out gains the new teardown step (no observable effect today since the store is empty without consumers). Bundle gains ~2.5 KB minified+gzip for the streaming module.
- **Forward-compat to Parts 2–7.** `useChat` (Part 2) will read `useStreamingSlice` for streaming fields and watch `slice.finalMessage` on the streaming→idle transition to fold the message into `messages[]` and immediately clear `finalMessage` via `setSlice` (P2.R7 no-flicker). Chat-input (Part 3) will gate Send by `useActiveStreamCount(teamId) >= 5` and call `cancelStream` for the per-conversation Stop button. Sidebar (Part 4) will subscribe to `useActiveStreamIds` and `useUnseenCompletionIds` for pulsating/solid dots and `useActiveStreamCount` for the footer count text. AppSidebar chat icon (Part 5) will use `useActiveStreamCount` ∨ `useHasAnyUnseenCompletion`. Workspace switching (P5.R5) is already isolated by the slice's `teamId` field and the aggregate hooks' `teamId` filter — no extra wiring needed when Part 5 lands.

### PRD-023 Part 5 — Codebase Cleanup: `database-query-service` Domain Split — 2026-04-26

The 2,036-LOC `lib/services/database-query-service.ts` monolith is split into a directory of domain modules under `lib/services/database-query/` while the public surface (`executeQuery`, `QueryAction`, `QueryFilters`, `DatabaseQueryResult`, `ACTION_METADATA`, `CHAT_TOOL_ACTIONS`, `buildChatToolDescription`) is preserved verbatim. Pure structural refactor — no SQL behaviour, no filter semantics, no log-line wording, and no result-shape change. Every dashboard widget, the chat `queryDatabase` tool, and the insight-aggregation pipeline produce identical outputs.

- **Increment 1 — Scaffold + extract shared helpers.** Created `lib/services/database-query/` directory with `types.ts` (QueryAction/QueryFilters/DatabaseQueryResult/ActionMeta/DrillDownRow), `action-metadata.ts` (ACTION_METADATA registry, CHAT_TOOL_ACTIONS, buildChatToolDescription, dev-time `assertChatToolActionsInSync`, `LOG_PREFIX`), and four shared modules under `shared/`: `base-query-builder.ts` (baseSessionQuery, baseClientQuery), `severity-filter.ts` (one cohesive module replacing the 3 legacy helpers `sessionHasSignalWithSeverity`/`applySeverityRowFilter`/`fetchSessionIdsMatchingSeverity` with `sessionHasSeverity`/`filterRowsBySeverity`/`resolveSessionIdsBySeverity`; bodies moved verbatim — P5.R2), `row-helpers.ts` (extractClientName, aggregateJsonField, dateTrunc), `theme-helpers.ts` (fetchActiveThemeMap, fetchSignalThemeRows, plus a new `applyThemeJoinFilters` that owns the team/date/clientIds chain shared by theme widgets and theme drill-down — P5.R3). Monolith continued to re-import the moved pieces; consumers untouched.
- **Increment 2 — Counts / distributions / sessions domains.** Moved 10 handlers verbatim into `domains/counts.ts` (count_clients, count_sessions, sessions_per_client, client_list — 141 LOC), `domains/distributions.ts` (sentiment_distribution, urgency_distribution, competitive_mention_frequency — 115 LOC), `domains/sessions.ts` (recent_sessions, sessions_over_time, client_health_grid — 136 LOC). Renamed call sites to use `filterRowsBySeverity` / `sessionHasSeverity`. ACTION_MAP unchanged in shape; handler references now resolve through imports.
- **Increment 3 — Themes domain.** Moved `top_themes`, `theme_trends`, `theme_client_matrix` into `domains/themes.ts` (180 LOC) verbatim. The inline `clientData` IIFE in `theme_client_matrix` stays inline (matrix-specific "all clients in scope" need; not generic enough to extract). Removed unused `baseClientQuery`/`fetchSignalThemeRows` imports from the monolith.
- **Increment 4 — Drill-down split + direct/competitor dedupe (P5.R4).** Three new modules: `domains/drilldown.ts` (router + drillDownSchema + buildFilterLabel + groupByClient + DRILL_DOWN_LIMIT — 229 LOC), `domains/drilldown-direct.ts` (shared `fetchDrillDownRows` skeleton + thin wrappers for direct and competitor — 243 LOC), `domains/drilldown-theme.ts` (signal_themes-first join, now using `applyThemeJoinFilters` for the team/date/clientIds chain — 142 LOC). The shared helper takes `{ clientId?, sessionPredicate?, embeddingChunkType?, embeddingPredicate?, logLabel? }` and parameterizes every behavioural difference between direct and competitor: direct supplies a scalar-`===` (case-sensitive) `sessionPredicate`; competitor supplies a `.toLowerCase()` array predicate plus `embeddingChunkType: "competitive_mention"` and a `.toLowerCase()` `embeddingPredicate` on `metadata.competitor`. The `logLabel` parameter ("competitor" or undefined) builds the exact pre-cleanup error log strings (`"drill_down session fetch error:"` vs `"drill_down competitor session fetch error:"`) and exception messages (`"Failed to fetch drill-down sessions"` vs `"…sessions for competitor"`) — verbatim, so production grep/alerting patterns continue to match. Theme drill-down stays separate (different SQL plan: `signal_themes ⨝ session_embeddings ⨝ sessions` with `theme_id` fixed up-front; forcing it through the direct/competitor helper would either change the plan or pollute the helper's options).
- **Increment 5 — Session-detail + insights; collapse to thin router; delete monolith; redirect consumers.** Created `domains/session-detail.ts` (handleSessionDetail — 65 LOC) and `domains/insights.ts` (handleInsightsLatest, handleInsightsHistory — 156 LOC). Created `execute-query.ts` (113 LOC; `ACTION_MAP` + `executeQuery` only, well under the 300-LOC ceiling — P5.R5). Created `index.ts` (27 LOC; re-exports the 7 public symbols — P5.R6). Deleted `lib/services/database-query-service.ts`. Redirected the 3 consumers' import paths: `app/api/dashboard/route.ts` (1 line), `lib/services/chat-stream-service.ts` (2 lines), `lib/services/insight-service.ts` (1 line) — all swapped from `@/lib/services/database-query-service` → `@/lib/services/database-query`. Symbol names unchanged at every call site.
- **End-of-part audit fixes.** Two DRY/P5.R3 violations found and fixed: (1) the embedding team-scoping inside `fetchDrillDownRows` was an inline `if/else` for the eq/is-null pattern — replaced with `scopeByTeam(embeddingQuery, filters.teamId)`; (2) `domains/insights.ts` had three near-identical `filters.teamId ? eq(...) : is(...)` ternaries — collapsed each to a `let q = supabase.from(...).select(...).order(...); q = scopeByTeam(q, filters.teamId);` shape. Both fixes emit identical SQL; behaviour preserved. After the fixes, the only remaining direct `team_id` references in the new module live inside `applyThemeJoinFilters` (signal_themes joins reference `session_embeddings.team_id` — `scopeByTeam` doesn't fit that path).
- **`LOG_PREFIX` literal preserved.** `"[database-query-service]"` defined exactly once in `action-metadata.ts:23`, imported by every domain module that emits logs. Production grep, alerting, and log-aggregation patterns continue to match. **Note for future reviewers:** do not normalize the prefix to `"[database-query]"` or anything else without auditing dashboards/alerts that key on the literal string.
- **Action-registry sync check still runs.** `assertChatToolActionsInSync` lives in `action-metadata.ts` at module scope under `if (process.env.NODE_ENV !== "production") { ... }`. ES module evaluation semantics fire it on first import via `index.ts` → `./action-metadata` (re-export) or via any domain module's `LOG_PREFIX` import. Same logical moment as pre-cleanup.
- **End-of-part audit.** `npx tsc --noEmit` (strict) and `npm run build` both pass clean. SRP: each domain module owns one query family; `execute-query.ts` is a router with no business logic; shared modules each own one cross-cutting concern. DRY: drill-down direct/competitor skeleton in exactly one place (`fetchDrillDownRows`); theme/date/clientIds filtering on signal_themes joins lives in `applyThemeJoinFilters`; severity logic in one module. LOC: every file ≤ 400 LOC; router 113 LOC. Dead code: monolith deleted, no stale references in `lib/`/`app/`. Convention: kebab-case files, named exports only, all `any` types carry `eslint-disable @typescript-eslint/no-explicit-any` with reason comments. **Behavior parity:** type-check and build prove the structural refactor compiles and links; byte-identical output for all 17 actions and 7 drill-down strategies relies on the verbatim handler moves, the explicit predicate-driven dedupe in drill-down, and the LOG_PREFIX/error-message preservation contract. A pre/post JSON-snapshot diff on representative fixture data is the residual empirical check (deferred — requires a fixture dataset and live Supabase).
- **Part 4 deferred to PRD-024 per the PRD.** No entry under PRD-023 P4. The `useChat` decomposition is enabled by PRD-024's `StreamingProvider` lift.
- **Final layout (17 files, ~2,186 LOC total — net +150 LOC vs. the 2,036-LOC monolith, all in module headers / option types / behaviour-preservation comments):**
  - `lib/services/database-query/index.ts` (27)
  - `lib/services/database-query/types.ts` (74)
  - `lib/services/database-query/action-metadata.ts` (179)
  - `lib/services/database-query/execute-query.ts` (113)
  - `shared/`: base-query-builder.ts (43), severity-filter.ts (118), row-helpers.ts (58), theme-helpers.ts (167)
  - `domains/`: counts.ts (141), distributions.ts (115), sessions.ts (136), themes.ts (180), drilldown.ts (229), drilldown-direct.ts (243), drilldown-theme.ts (142), session-detail.ts (65), insights.ts (156)
- **Forward-compat:** Adding a new action (e.g., a hypothetical `count_archived_sessions`) edits exactly four files: `types.ts` (extend the union — TypeScript flags any miss), `action-metadata.ts` (registry entry; `assertChatToolActionsInSync` guards the LLM-tuple sync), the relevant `domains/*.ts` (add the handler), and `execute-query.ts` (register in ACTION_MAP). No theme/insight/drill-down module touched. The shared helpers (`baseSessionQuery`, `severity-filter` exports, `applyThemeJoinFilters`, `fetchDrillDownRows`) are stable seams for future SQL-shape extensions.

### PRD-023 Part 3 — Codebase Cleanup: Session Orchestrator — 2026-04-26

The ~50-line `after(generateSessionEmbeddings → assignSessionThemes → maybeRefreshDashboardInsights)` chain previously inlined and duplicated across `POST /api/sessions` and `PUT /api/sessions/[id]` is consolidated into a single orchestrator function. `after()` registration and `maxDuration = 60` stay in the routes; only the *body* of the `after()` callback changed. No user-facing behaviour change.

- **Increment 1 — Created `runSessionPostResponseChain` in `lib/services/session-orchestrator.ts`.** Single exported function owning the post-response chain end-to-end: builds `sessionMeta`, selects chunks (`chunkStructuredSignals` vs `chunkRawNotes`), creates the four chain repos (embedding/theme/signalTheme/insight), runs the three stages with per-stage timing logs, and catches/logs the unconditional `EMBEDDING+THEME+INSIGHTS CHAIN FAILED` error with sessionId + elapsedMs + stack. Returns `void`; failures are logged but never rethrown (caller registers in `after()` and does not await). The body uses `async/await + try/catch` instead of the previous `.then().then().catch()` chain — same sequencing, more readable, satisfies P3.R5's explicit "no inline `.then().then().catch()` chain" criterion. Lives in its own module rather than `session-service.ts` (which already owns CRUD + access control) to keep SRP — and to make it the natural target if/when a queue worker replaces `after()` per Decision #19's migration trigger.
- **Increment 2 — Migrated `POST /api/sessions` to call the orchestrator.** Replaced the ~75-line inline chain block (sessionMeta build, structuredJson derivation, chunks computation, four repo creations, `.then().then().catch()` chain) with a single `after(runSessionPostResponseChain({...}))` call. Removed nine chain-only imports: `EXTRACTION_SCHEMA_VERSION`, `createEmbeddingRepository`, `createThemeRepository`, `createSignalThemeRepository`, `createInsightRepository`, `maybeRefreshDashboardInsights`, `generateSessionEmbeddings`, `assignSessionThemes`, `chunkStructuredSignals`/`chunkRawNotes`, `SessionMeta`. Kept `ExtractedSignals` for the inline cast at the orchestrator call site (`(parsed.data.structuredJson as ExtractedSignals | null) ?? null`). Route file now **196 LOC** (was ~273).
- **Increment 3 — Migrated `PUT /api/sessions/[id]` to call the orchestrator.** Same recipe as Increment 2. The PUT-specific `structuredJson` derivation (`isExtraction`-gated) stays as a 3-line `chainStructuredJson` local before the orchestrator call — it's request-shape concern, not chain logic. `isReExtraction: true` is the PUT-only flag passed through to delete existing embeddings before re-embedding. Route file now **197 LOC** (was ~285).
- **Log prefix preserved verbatim (P3.R2).** The orchestrator accepts a `logPrefix` parameter; routes pass `"[POST /api/sessions]"` and `"[PUT /api/sessions/[id]]"` byte-for-byte. Production grep patterns and Vercel-log dashboards keying on the route prefix continue to match. **Note for future reviewers:** do not normalize the prefix to a single `[session-orchestrator]` value without reviewing dashboards/alerts that depend on the per-route prefix.
- **`after()` and `maxDuration = 60` stay in routes (P3.R3).** Next.js segment configs aren't statically resolvable across module boundaries, so `maxDuration` must remain in the route file. `after()` keeps the per-route lifetime extension semantics — only the callback body changed.
- **End-of-part audit.** ESLint passes on all three Part 3 files (`@typescript-eslint/no-unused-vars` enforced); `npx tsc --noEmit` (strict) and `npm run build` both succeed. Grep confirms zero hits for chain-only symbols (`chunkStructuredSignals`, `chunkRawNotes`, `EXTRACTION_SCHEMA_VERSION`, `generateSessionEmbeddings`, `assignSessionThemes`, `maybeRefreshDashboardInsights`, the four chain repo factories, `SessionMeta`) anywhere under `app/api/sessions/`. SRP/DRY/logging/dead-code/convention checks all clean.
- **Forward-compat:** The orchestrator's stable `SessionPostResponseChainInput` shape is the migration boundary for Decision #19's queue-worker trigger (Inngest, QStash, or Supabase queues). When chain duration or failure-rate signals demand it, a queue-job handler can call `runSessionPostResponseChain` unchanged — only `serviceClient` needs to be re-created from job context. Adding a new chain stage is a single-file edit to the orchestrator with no route changes.

### PRD-023 Part 2 — Codebase Cleanup: Shared Route Helpers — 2026-04-26

The 7-line `createClient → getUser → 401 → service-client → repo → role-check` block duplicated across ~15 API routes is extracted into a small set of helpers in a new `lib/api/` directory. File-upload validation (size + MIME) shared by two routes is consolidated. The inline `profiles.can_create_team` query in `POST /api/teams` is moved into `team-service.ts`. No user-facing behaviour change beyond a single 401-message normalization (see "Wording change" below).

- **Increment 1 — `requireAuth` foundation.** Created `lib/api/route-auth.ts` with `AuthContext` type and `requireAuth(): Promise<AuthContext | NextResponse>`. Returns user + supabase + serviceClient on success or a 401 NextResponse on failure. Caller pattern: `const auth = await requireAuth(); if (auth instanceof NextResponse) return auth;`.
- **Increment 2 — Team-context helpers.** Added `requireTeamMember`, `requireTeamAdmin`, `requireTeamOwner` (each `(teamId, user, forbiddenMessage?) => Promise<TeamContext | NextResponse>`) backed by a private `loadTeamContext` with a `RequiredRole` switch. Role hierarchy honours the actual schema: roles on `team_members` are `"admin" | "sales"`; ownership is orthogonal and lives on `teams.owner_id`. Owner-level routes check `team.owner_id === user.id`; admin-level routes check `member.role === "admin"` (owners satisfy this because `team-repository.create()` adds the owner as an `admin` member). Optional `forbiddenMessage` lets routes preserve their contextual 403 wording (e.g., "Only the team owner can rename the team") per P2.R5. Added `idempotentNoOp(message)` for the canonical 409 "no-op" response (initially in `route-auth.ts`; see audit cleanup below).
- **Active-team server cookie move (prerequisite to Increment 3).** Moved `getActiveTeamId()` out of `lib/supabase/server.ts` (which was mixing Supabase client construction with workspace-cookie reading) into a new `lib/cookies/active-team-server.ts`, paired with the existing client-side `lib/cookies/active-team.ts`. Updated all 18 callers (17 routes/pages + the new `route-auth.ts`) to import from the new path. `lib/supabase/server.ts` now exclusively exports Supabase client factories.
- **Increment 3 — `requireSessionAccess` helper.** Added `requireSessionAccess(sessionId, user): Promise<SessionContext | NextResponse>` to `lib/api/route-auth.ts`. Internally resolves teamId, builds session + team repos, calls the existing framework-agnostic `checkSessionAccess` from `session-service.ts`, and translates the discriminated-union result via the existing `lib/utils/map-access-error.ts` — so the reason → status-code mapping is owned in exactly one place.
- **Increment 4 — `validateFileUpload` helper.** Created `lib/api/file-validation.ts` exporting `validateFileUpload(file): { valid: true } | { valid: false; message }`. Reads `MAX_FILE_SIZE_BYTES` and `ACCEPTED_FILE_TYPES` from `lib/constants.ts` (single source). Per-session `MAX_ATTACHMENTS` cap intentionally stays in routes — collection-level concern.
- **Increment 5 — `canUserCreateTeam` extracted.** Added `canUserCreateTeam(profileRepo, userId)` to `lib/services/team-service.ts`, returning `{ allowed: true } | { allowed: false; reason: "profile_not_found" | "feature_disabled" }` (matching the codebase's `checkSessionAccess` discriminated-union convention). The service takes a `ProfileRepository` (created via the existing `createProfileRepository` factory) per the codebase's repo-first service convention. `POST /api/teams` replaced its 20-line inline `supabase.from("profiles").select("can_create_team")` block with the service call. Status codes (500 for profile-not-found, 403 for feature-disabled) and error messages preserved.
- **Increment 6 — Team routes migrated (11 routes).** All routes under `app/api/teams/**` now use the helpers: `teams/route.ts` (GET, POST → `requireAuth`); `teams/[teamId]/route.ts` (GET → `requireTeamMember`, PATCH/DELETE → `requireTeamOwner`); `transfer/route.ts` POST → `requireTeamOwner`; `leave/route.ts` POST → `requireTeamMember`; `members/route.ts` GET → `requireTeamMember`; `members/[userId]/route.ts` DELETE → `requireTeamMember` (the admin-removing-admin guard and "no permission to remove members" branches stay inline as business logic); `members/[userId]/role/route.ts` PATCH → `requireTeamOwner` (already adopting `idempotentNoOp` from Inc. 2); `invitations/route.ts` (GET → `requireTeamMember`-equivalent, POST → `requireTeamAdmin`); `invitations/[invitationId]/route.ts` DELETE → `requireTeamAdmin`; `invitations/[invitationId]/resend/route.ts` POST → `requireTeamAdmin`. The self-removal 400 check in `members/[userId]/route.ts` DELETE was moved before the helper call to preserve the existing status-code ordering. **Edge-case status shift (one route):** `GET /api/teams/[teamId]` previously returned `403 "You are not a member of this team"` even when the team didn't exist (membership lookup ran before team lookup). Post-migration the helper checks team existence first and returns `404 "Team not found"` for non-existent teams — semantically more correct. Dominant 403 case (existing team, non-member) is unchanged.
- **Increment 7 — Session + attachment routes migrated (6 routes).** `sessions/route.ts` (GET, POST → `requireAuth`); `sessions/[id]/route.ts` (PUT, DELETE → `requireAuth` + `requireSessionAccess`); `sessions/[id]/attachments/route.ts` (GET → `requireAuth` + `requireSessionAccess`; POST → adds `validateFileUpload`); `sessions/[id]/attachments/[attachmentId]/route.ts` DELETE; `sessions/[id]/attachments/[attachmentId]/download/route.ts` GET; `sessions/prompt-versions/route.ts` GET → `requireAuth`. Inline `MAX_FILE_SIZE_BYTES` + `ACCEPTED_FILE_TYPES` checks in the attachments POST removed (now via `validateFileUpload`).
- **Increment 8 — AI + file-parse routes migrated (3 routes).** `ai/extract-signals/route.ts` POST → `requireAuth`; `ai/generate-master-signal/route.ts` POST → `requireAuth` (the conditional team-admin check stays inline because the route allows personal workspace, where `teamId === null` — `requireTeamAdmin` requires a teamId); `files/parse/route.ts` POST → `requireAuth` + `validateFileUpload`. The hardcoded `"File exceeds 10MB limit"` string in this route became the dynamic `${MAX_FILE_SIZE_BYTES / (1024 * 1024)}MB` form, which resolves identically today.
- **Audit cleanup (mid-Part) — `idempotentNoOp` moved out of `route-auth.ts`.** Per the SRP principle, the generic 409 response factory doesn't belong in an auth-helpers module. Extracted to `lib/api/idempotent-no-op.ts`; the role-update route's import was updated. `route-auth.ts` is now strictly auth/role/session helpers.
- **Wording change.** `GET /api/sessions` and `POST /api/sessions` previously returned `401 { message: "Unauthorized" }` (the only two routes using this minority spelling). Post-migration they return `401 { message: "Authentication required" }` via `requireAuth`. Status code identical; the message normalizes to the dominant codebase convention (~18 other routes already used "Authentication required" directly or via `mapAccessError("unauthenticated")`). All other migrated routes' messages, status codes, and bodies are byte-for-byte unchanged.
- **End-of-part audit.** ESLint passes on every Part 2 file (`@typescript-eslint/no-unused-vars` enforced via `eslint-config-next/typescript`); `npx tsc --noEmit` (strict) and `npm run build` both succeed. SRP/DRY/logging/dead-code/convention checks all clean — see TRD audit checklist for the full list.
- **Out of scope, deferred:** routes still using inline `auth.getUser()` are explicitly outside P2.R2's list — `chat/conversations/*`, `chat/send`, `dashboard/insights`, `invite/[token]/accept`, `master-signal/route.ts`, and `prompts/*`. Dashboard-route migration is anticipated in Part 5 (when the query service is split); prompt routes in Part 9.

### PRD-023 Part 1 — Codebase Cleanup: Quick Wins — 2026-04-26

Six independent, low-risk fixes shipped together. Each is verified individually; no behavioral change for end users.

- **Increment 1 — Dead file removal.** Deleted the 0-byte `app/api/sessions/_helpers.ts` (no imports referenced it).
- **Increment 2 — Theme toggle consolidated.** Added `toggleTheme` to `lib/hooks/use-theme.ts` so the dark↔light inversion lives in exactly one place. `components/layout/theme-toggle.tsx` now consumes it. Sidebar's "More" dropdown menu item and the public landing-page footer (`app/_components/landing-page.tsx`) both call `toggleTheme` directly — sidebar via `useTheme()` for the icon/label, landing page via `<ThemeToggle />`. Zero `setTheme(theme === "dark" ? "light" : "dark")` patterns remain in the codebase outside the hook.
- **Increment 3 — Role-update no-op returns 409.** `PATCH /api/teams/[teamId]/members/[userId]/role` now returns `409 { message: "Member already has role 'admin'" }` (with the actual current role interpolated) when the requested role matches the current role, replacing the previous misleading implicit `200 { message: "Role unchanged" }`. Server logs the no-op branch for observability. Frontend (`team-members-table.tsx#handleRoleChange`) branches on `res.status === 409` and surfaces a `toast.warning` instead of a misleading success or generic error toast. Note: the UI's role `<Select>` doesn't fire `onValueChange` on no-op selections (Radix behaviour), so this path is mostly defensive — it covers direct API callers and rare admin-edit race conditions.
- **Increment 4 — `cn()` migration.** Replaced template-literal `className` strings with `cn()` calls in 5 files: `app/layout.tsx`, `app/capture/_components/prompt-version-filter.tsx`, `app/capture/_components/session-table-row.tsx`, `app/chat/_components/message-thread.tsx`, `app/invite/[token]/_components/invite-shell.tsx`. Repo-wide grep for `className={\`` returns zero hits.
- **Increment 5 — Chart hex centralization.** Added `CHART_HIGH_CONTRAST_TEXT_HEX` to `app/dashboard/_components/chart-colours.ts`. `session-volume-widget.tsx` now references the existing `BRAND_PRIMARY_HEX` constant; `theme-client-matrix-widget.tsx` references `CHART_HIGH_CONTRAST_TEXT_HEX`. No raw hex codes remain in dashboard widget files (the white background in `export-dashboard.ts` is intentional and out of chart scope).
- **Increment 6 — `any` annotation audit.** Verified that every `: any` in `app/`, `components/`, and `lib/` has a preceding `// eslint-disable-next-line @typescript-eslint/no-explicit-any -- <reason>` comment. All 10 occurrences are justified; convention is fully observed. `database-query-service.ts` `any`s are explicitly deferred to PRD-023 Part 5 (where the file gets rewritten).
- **Audit cleanups.** Removed unused imports surfaced during the end-of-part audit: `useCallback` and `Users` from `landing-page.tsx`. Reordered imports in `app/layout.tsx`, `invite-shell.tsx`, and `app-sidebar.tsx` to match CLAUDE.md's stated order (utils → components → services/hooks).

**Out of scope, flagged for follow-up:** pre-existing ESLint findings remain in `theme-client-matrix-widget.tsx` (memoization deps), `app-sidebar.tsx`/`use-theme.ts` (set-state-in-effect), and `landing-page.tsx` (refs-during-render). These predate Part 1 and belong to the larger decompositions tracked in PRD-023 Parts 5/6/7.

### Gap P9 — ChatGPT-style conversation routing — 2026-04-26

- Created `app/chat/[id]/page.tsx` — server component, validates UUID with regex, calls `notFound()` for malformed paths, renders `<ChatPageContent initialConversationId={id} />`. Both route files now seed initial state from the URL on first arrival, hard refresh, deep-link, or share; from then on, all in-session URL updates use raw `window.history` API and the chat shell never remounts.
- `ChatPageContent` accepts an optional `initialConversationId?: string` prop. `activeConversationId: string | null` — `null` is a real first-class state representing "fresh chat, no DB row, URL `/chat`." Lazy initializer reads the prop or starts at `null`. Dropped the `isFresh` derivation (replaced by direct null vs. non-null checks). Dropped the `handleSendMessage` wrapper's pre-send sidebar prepend (moved into `handleConversationCreated`).
- `useChat` rewired: `UseChatOptions.conversationId: string | null`. Dropped `isFresh` prop and `isFreshRef`. Re-introduced `onConversationCreated?: (id: string) => void` option. `sendMessage` now generates the conversation UUID inline via `crypto.randomUUID()` when `conversationIdRef.current === null` and notifies the parent with `onConversationCreated(generatedId)` exactly once per fresh send, after the server confirms via response headers. Added `messagesRef` and `prevConversationIdRef` for the load-messages effect's `null → just-created` skip-refetch guard.
- Three navigation primitives in `ChatPageContent` using raw `window.history`: `navigateToConversation(id)` (`pushState` + `clearMessages` + `setActiveConversationId`), `navigateToFreshChat()` (`pushState '/chat'` + clear + null), `silentlyAssignConversationId(id)` (`pushState` + setActive — no clear, since messages are already populated by streaming). `pushState` everywhere preserves the natural browser history chain so back from `/chat/<id>` returns to `/chat` (empty fresh chat) before exiting. `<Link>` and `router.push`/`router.replace` removed from the chat shell entirely.
- `ChatArea` empty-state branch is gated on `activeConversationId === null` (raw id from parent) rather than `activeConversation === null` (looked-up sidebar entry). The lookup briefly returns null during the conversations-list fetch window on a fresh mount of `/chat/[id]` (e.g. forward-navigation from a different page); the raw-id check prevents flashing the "Start a new conversation" starter panel while the conversation is loading.
- `popstate` listener for browser back/forward — reads URL via the same UUID regex used in the route file, calls `clearMessages()` + `setActiveConversationId(parsed)` in the same handler so React batches both updates into one render commit (no flash of stale messages).
- Added `clearMessages: () => void` to `UseChatReturn` — atomic message reset for use around in-app navigation.
- Added `isConversationNotFound: boolean` to `UseChatReturn`. Load-messages effect detects `res.status === 404` specifically; `ChatArea` renders a dedicated 404 panel with the `FileQuestion` icon, "Conversation not found" copy, and a "Start a new chat" CTA wired to `navigateToFreshChat`. Input bar hidden in the not-found state.
- Sidebar items remain the original `<div role="button" onClick={onSelect}>` (the prior P9 implementation's `<Link>` conversion was reverted) — required because each row contains a `<DropdownMenuTrigger>` which is a real `<button>`, and nesting buttons is invalid HTML. Full keyboard a11y preserved via `tabIndex`/`onKeyDown`/`role`.
- **Relationship to E15.** P9 supersedes E15's *client mechanism* (lazy UUID at component mount, `isFresh` derivation, in-handler sidebar prepend) but preserves E15's *server contract* unchanged (`getOrCreateConversation` idempotency, `ConversationNotAccessibleError` → 404, `MessageDuplicateError` → 409). The "client owns conversation UUIDs" thesis from E15 is intact; the UUID just materialises later (on first send) instead of at mount.

### Gap E15 — Client-generated conversation UUIDs — 2026-04-25

- `ChatPageContent` initialises `activeConversationId` lazily via `crypto.randomUUID()` and regenerates it on "New chat". Conversation UUID is sent in the POST body alongside `userMessageId`.
- Server-side `getOrCreateConversation` (in `chat-service.ts`) handles the idempotency: tries INSERT with the client-supplied UUID, falls back to fetch-by-id on Postgres unique-violation (code 23505). Cross-user UUID collisions (RLS hides the row) surface as `ConversationNotAccessibleError` → 404. `ConversationInsert` accepts an optional `id`; the Supabase repo passes it through and propagates the raw Postgres error so the service can detect the code.
- `lib/hooks/use-chat.ts` cleanup: `conversationId` prop narrowed to `string` (no longer nullable); `onConversationCreated` callback + `onConversationCreatedRef` removed; `prevConversationIdRef` flicker patch removed (the `null → just-created` transition no longer exists). New `isFresh` prop (mirrored to `isFreshRef`) tells the load-messages effect to skip fetching for freshly-generated local UUIDs that don't have a DB row yet.
- `ChatPageContent` derives `isFresh` from sidebar list-membership and wraps `chatHook.sendMessage` to optimistically prepend fresh conversations to the sidebar before the first POST. Existing `handleConversationCreated` callback removed — the prepend logic moved into the wrapper.
- `X-Conversation-Id` response header is now informational only; the client already knows the conversation UUID.

### Gap E14 — Chat message ID ownership + orphan row cleanup — 2026-04-25

- **Client-generated UUIDs for user messages.** `useChat.sendMessage` now uses `crypto.randomUUID()` for the optimistic message ID, sends it in the POST body as `userMessageId`, and the server inserts with that explicit primary key. End-to-end identifier stability — same UUID in optimistic React state, network payload, and DB row. No more `temp-user-…` swap step.
- **Server-generated UUID for assistant messages, surfaced via response header.** Added `X-Assistant-Message-Id` to the `/api/chat/send` SSE response. Client reads it at fetch-response time and stores in `assistantMessageIdRef`. Used as the authoritative ID for both the success-path completed message and the cancel-path cancelled message; the `done` SSE event's `messageId` is now a paranoid fallback.
- **Stream finalization aligned across success / error / abort.** `chat-stream-service.ts` lifts `fullText` to outer scope so the catch block preserves partial content. Outer catch now differentiates `isAbort` (via `request.signal.aborted` or `AbortError`) from genuine errors and updates the placeholder row to `status: "cancelled"` or `"failed"` with the partial content. `request.signal` plumbed through `route.ts` → `createChatStream` → `streamText({ abortSignal })` so client cancels also cancel the upstream provider call.
- **Idempotent retries via DB primary key.** Repository `messages.create()` now propagates the raw Postgres error (was wrapping in a generic Error and losing the code). Service layer catches code `23505` and throws the new `MessageDuplicateError`. Route maps it to a 409 `{ message: "Message already received" }` response.
- Resolves the E14 user-visible symptoms: orphan placeholder rows stuck at `status: "streaming"`, lost partial content on errors, and unreferenceable user messages within an active session.

### Gap E4 — Chat `queryDatabase` registry + dashboard-equivalent expressivity — 2026-04-25

- Added `ACTION_METADATA` registry in `lib/services/database-query-service.ts` — single source of truth for which `QueryAction` values are exposed to the LLM via the chat `queryDatabase` tool, with per-action descriptions surfaced to the model.
- Derived `CHAT_TOOL_ACTIONS` tuple, `ChatToolAction` type, and `buildChatToolDescription()` helper from the registry. Added a dev-time module-load assertion that catches drift between the static tuple and the registry's `llmToolExposed` flag.
- `chat-stream-service.ts` — deleted hardcoded `QUERY_ACTIONS` array; chat tool's Zod enum and description now derived from the registry. New `QueryAction` entries produce a TypeScript error in `ACTION_METADATA` until classified — drift is structurally prevented.
- Chat tool now exposes 15 actions to the LLM (up from 7) — adds `sessions_over_time`, `client_health_grid`, `competitive_mention_frequency`, `top_themes`, `theme_trends`, `theme_client_matrix`, `insights_latest`, `insights_history`. `drill_down` and `session_detail` remain reachable via direct API/UI fetches but unexposed to LLM tool selection.
- Filter input expanded from 3 fields to 8: added `clientIds[]`, `severity`, `urgency`, `granularity`, `confidenceMin` to match dashboard filter dimensions.
- `severity` made a real filter end-to-end (was previously a silent no-op everywhere). Implemented post-filter on `structured_json` (per-chunk `severity` across `painPoints`/`requirements`/`aspirations`/`blockers`/`custom.signals`) in `count_sessions`, `sessions_per_client`, `sentiment_distribution`, `urgency_distribution`, `recent_sessions`, `client_health_grid`. Theme handlers (`top_themes`, `theme_trends`, `theme_client_matrix`) pre-resolve matching session IDs and constrain the join. Quiet upgrade for the dashboard URL `severity=` param, which now actually filters too. `sessions_over_time` is the one deferred handler — RPC-based aggregation needs RPC change; flagged in registry description and TRD.
- Resolves P3 ("Chat can't answer theme or competitive questions") — was the user-visible symptom of E4.

### Gap P5 — Shared filter persistence — 2026-04-25

- Added `lib/hooks/use-filter-storage.ts` — sessionStorage-backed filter persistence primitive keyed by `filters:<surface>:<userId>:<workspaceId|personal>`. Narrow `{ key, read, write }` API so each surface owns its own sync policy.
- Wired dashboard `filter-bar.tsx` to the hook — restores filters from storage on mount/workspace-change when the URL has no filter params; mirrors URL → storage on every filter change.
- Wired capture `past-sessions-table.tsx` to the hook — hydrates React filter state from storage on mount/workspace-change; persists state → storage on every filter update.
- `setActiveTeam()` in `auth-provider.tsx` now calls `router.replace(pathname)` on workspace switch to strip URL query params, per the P5 contract ("workspace switch is a fresh context").
- No cleanup on signOut needed — `userId` in the storage key makes stale entries from a prior user inert, and tab close clears `sessionStorage`.

### PRD-022 Layout Cleanup — 2026-04-12

**Part 1 — Settings Accordion in Sidebar + Shared Page Header:**
- Replaced the "Settings" nav link in `app-sidebar.tsx` with a collapsible Settings accordion containing "Team Management" and "Extraction Prompt" sub-links.
- Created reusable `PageHeader` component (`components/layout/page-header.tsx`) and adopted it on Dashboard and Capture pages.
- Replaced the tabbed settings page (`app/settings/page.tsx`) with a redirect to `/settings/team`.

**Part 2 — Dedicated Team Management Page:**
- Created dedicated team management page (`app/settings/team/page.tsx`) restricted to team admins.
- Created `team-management-client.tsx` to group existing components into "Access" and "Manage Team" sections.
- Safely deleted `app/settings/_components/team-settings.tsx`.

**Part 3 — Dedicated Extraction Prompt Page:**
- Created dedicated extraction prompt page (`app/settings/prompts/page.tsx`) with full edit access for personal/admins and read-only for non-admins.
- Created `extraction-prompt-client.tsx` and `use-extraction-prompt.ts` focused solely on the single signal extraction prompt.
- Removed tabs UI and master signal prompts; deleted dead code (`prompt-editor-page-content.tsx`, `prompt-master-signal-notice.tsx`, `prompt-unsaved-dialog.tsx`, `use-prompt-editor.ts`, `settings-page-content.tsx`).

**Part 4 — Landing Page Refresh:**
- Updated marketing copy on `/` to reflect the current product value (Insights Dashboard + Chat).
- Swapped out "Cross-Client Synthesis" feature card for "Insights Dashboard" and "Ask Your Data".
- Updated Step 3 in "How It Works" to "Understand" instead of "Synthesise".
- Purged all mentions of the deprecated "master signal" from the landing page.

### PRD-021 Part 6: Filters and Interactivity — 2026-04-12

**Cross-widget filtering (P6.R2):**
- Shift+click on sentiment/urgency/client-health widget data points sets global URL filters (`severity`, `urgency`, `clients`) that all widgets respond to via existing `useDashboardFetch` + `FilterBar` infrastructure
- `applyWidgetFilter()` callback in `dashboard-content.tsx` — receives `Record<string, string>`, merges into URL params via `router.replace()`
- Three widgets updated with `onFilter` prop and `event.shiftKey` detection: `sentiment-widget.tsx`, `urgency-widget.tsx`, `client-health-widget.tsx`

**Data freshness indicator (P6.R6):**
- `freshness-context.tsx` — lightweight context providing `onFetchComplete` callback, avoids prop-drilling through 8 widgets
- `freshness-indicator.tsx` — "Data as of just now / Nm ago / HH:MM" display with 30-second auto-refresh timer
- `use-dashboard-fetch.ts` — calls `onFetchComplete()` from context after each successful fetch
- `dashboard-content.tsx` — ref+state pair with 30s interval sync, wraps children in `FreshnessContext.Provider`

**Dashboard screenshot export (P6.R7):**
- `export-dashboard.ts` — `exportDashboardAsImage()` utility: dynamically imports `html2canvas` (~200KB deferred), prepends temporary filter context header to capture area, captures at 2x retina scale, triggers PNG download with date-stamped filename, cleans up header in `finally` block
- `filter-bar.tsx` — "Export as Image" button with Camera icon (Loader2 spinner during export), `onExport`/`isExporting` props, positioned right via `ml-auto`
- `dashboard-content.tsx` — `dashboardRef` on wrapper div, `isExporting` state, `activeFilters` derived from URL params, `handleExport` async callback

**Audit fixes:**
- `freshness-indicator.tsx` — replaced string concatenation with `cn()` for className composition
- `dashboard-content.tsx` — fixed indentation inside `dashboardRef` wrapper div

**Already implemented (no changes needed):**
- P6.R1 (global filter propagation) — Part 2
- P6.R3 (widget loading states) — Part 2
- P6.R4 (widget error states) — Part 2
- P6.R5 (empty states per widget) — Part 2

---

### PRD-021 Part 5: AI-Generated Headline Insights — 2026-04-12

**Database:**
- `dashboard_insights` table — `id` (UUID PK), `content` (text), `insight_type` (CHECK: trend/anomaly/milestone), `batch_id` (UUID), `team_id` (FK nullable), `created_by` (FK), `generated_at` (timestamptz); indexes on `(team_id, batch_id)` and `(team_id, generated_at DESC)`; RLS policies for team member reads, personal workspace reads, and authenticated inserts

**New lib files:**
- `lib/types/insight.ts` — `InsightType`, `DashboardInsight`, `InsightBatch` types
- `lib/schemas/headline-insights-schema.ts` — Zod schema for LLM response (1–5 classified insight items), `HeadlineInsightsResponse` inferred type
- `lib/prompts/headline-insights.ts` — system prompt (3–5 change-focused, classified, no-fabrication rules), `InsightAggregates` interface, `buildHeadlineInsightsUserMessage()` user message builder with previous batch comparison
- `lib/repositories/insight-repository.ts` — `InsightRepository` interface (`getLatestBatch`, `getPreviousBatches`, `insertBatch`, `getLastGeneratedAt`) + `InsightInsert` type
- `lib/repositories/supabase/supabase-insight-repository.ts` — Supabase adapter with `mapRow()`, `groupIntoBatches()`, inline team scoping
- `lib/services/insight-service.ts` — `generateHeadlineInsights()` (5 aggregate queries in parallel via `executeQuery()` → previous batch fetch → `callModelObject()` → batch insert), `maybeRefreshDashboardInsights()` (staleness check via session count since last generation, fire-and-forget safe)

**API routes:**
- `POST /api/dashboard/insights` — auth check, service-role client, calls `generateHeadlineInsights()`, returns `{ insights }`
- `insights_latest` and `insights_history` read actions added to `GET /api/dashboard` Zod enum and `database-query-service.ts` action map (now 17 actions)

**New UI components:**
- `use-insights.ts` — `useInsights()` hook: fetches latest batch on mount, `refresh()` POSTs for new generation, `loadPrevious()` lazy-loads history
- `insight-cards-row.tsx` — horizontal scrollable card row with type-specific styling (trend=blue/info, anomaly=amber/warning, milestone=green/success), relative timestamp, "Refresh Insights" button with spinner, skeleton/error/empty states
- `previous-insights.tsx` — collapsible `<details>/<summary>` with lazy load on first expand, compact batch list with type icons and formatted dates

**Dashboard wiring:**
- `dashboard-content.tsx` — `useInsights()` called in `DashboardInner`, `InsightCardsRow` + `PreviousInsights` rendered between FilterBar and widget grid

**Auto-refresh wiring:**
- `app/api/sessions/route.ts` POST — fire-and-forget chain extended: `generateEmbeddings() → assignThemes() → maybeRefreshDashboardInsights()`
- `app/api/sessions/[id]/route.ts` PUT — same chain extension for re-extraction flow

---

### PRD-021 Part 4: Qualitative Drill-Down — 2026-04-12

**New components:**
- `drill-down-types.ts` — `DrillDownContext` discriminated union (7 variants: sentiment, urgency, client, competitor, theme, theme_bucket, theme_client), `DrillDownSignal`, `DrillDownClientGroup`, `DrillDownResult` interfaces
- `drill-down-content.tsx` — Presentation-agnostic drill-down body; fetches data via `useDashboardFetch` with `drill_down` action; renders count header (with truncation indicator), filter label, client accordion (native `<details>/<summary>`, multiple open simultaneously), signal rows with chunk-type badge, theme badge, session date, text truncation toggle, "View Session" button; loading/error/empty states
- `drill-down-panel.tsx` — Thin Sheet shell (side="right", 45vw desktop / full mobile) wrapping `DrillDownContent`; swappable to Dialog in one file change; owns `SessionPreviewDialog` state
- `session-preview-dialog.tsx` — Dialog wrapping `StructuredSignalView`; fetches session via `session_detail` action; client name + date in header; loading skeleton, error retry, no-data states

**Database query service extensions:**
- `drill_down` action — Zod-validated discriminated union payload with 7 dispatch strategies: 3 direct (sentiment, urgency, client via `fetchDirectDrillDownRows`), 1 competitor (sessions + filtered embeddings), 3 theme (signal_themes join via `fetchThemeDrillDownRows` with optional bucket/client narrowing); results grouped by client via `groupByClient()`, capped at 100 signals
- `session_detail` action — fetches single session by ID with team scoping, returns `structuredJson`, `clientName`, `sessionDate`
- `drillDown?: string` and `sessionId?: string` added to `QueryFilters`

**API route extensions:**
- 2 new actions (`drill_down`, `session_detail`) added to Zod enum
- `drillDown: z.string().optional()` and `sessionId: z.string().uuid().optional()` params

**Widget wiring (7 widgets):**
- All 7 clickable widgets now accept `onDrillDown?: (context: DrillDownContext) => void` prop
- `dashboard-content.tsx` manages `drillDownContext` state, passes `handleDrillDown` callback to all widgets, renders `DrillDownPanel`
- All `console.log` drill-down stubs replaced with actual `onDrillDown` calls
- `client-health-widget.tsx` — `clientId` added to `ScatterPoint` for drill-down
- `theme-trends-widget.tsx` — `activeDot.onClick` handler dispatches `theme_bucket` context
- `SessionVolumeWidget` intentionally excluded (no meaningful click interaction)

**Shared infrastructure (DRY):**
- `CHUNK_TYPE_LABELS`, `formatChunkType()`, `formatChunkTypePlural()` extracted to `chart-colours.ts` — replaces local definitions in `drill-down-content.tsx` and `top-themes-widget.tsx`

---

### PRD-021 Part 3: Derived Theme Widgets — 2026-04-12

**New dashboard widgets:**
- Top Themes — horizontal BarChart (layout="vertical") ranked by signal count descending; custom tooltip shows per-chunk-type breakdown (e.g., "5 Pain points, 3 Requirements, 2 Blockers"); 15-theme default with "Show all N themes" toggle; clickable bars (drill-down stub for Part 4); spans 2 grid columns
- Theme Trends — multi-line LineChart with X-axis time buckets, Y-axis signal count, each theme a separate coloured line; defaults to top 5 themes by total count; local theme multi-select (Popover + Command); local week/month granularity toggle; 8-colour cycling palette; spans 2 grid columns
- Theme-Client Matrix — HTML heatmap grid (not Recharts); themes on rows, clients on columns; cell background opacity proportional to count; sticky row/column headers for scrollable overflow; custom positioned tooltip ("Theme X + Client Y: N signals"); clickable cells (drill-down stub for Part 4); spans 3 grid columns

**Database query service extensions:**
- 3 new actions: `top_themes` (aggregate by theme_id with chunk_type sub-counts), `theme_trends` (group by date_trunc + theme_id), `theme_client_matrix` (sparse cells grouped by theme_id + client_id)
- `confidenceMin?: number` added to `QueryFilters` — filters signal_themes by confidence threshold (available as URL param `?confidenceMin=0.8`, UI slider deferred to Part 6)
- `fetchActiveThemeMap()` shared helper — queries `themes` table for workspace-scoped id→name Map
- `fetchSignalThemeRows()` shared helper — multi-table join (`signal_themes` → `session_embeddings!inner` → `sessions!inner`) with team scoping, date range, client IDs, and confidence threshold
- `dateTrunc()` utility — week (Monday-aligned) and month truncation for TypeScript-side grouping

**API route extensions:**
- 3 new actions added to Zod enum in `/api/dashboard` route
- `confidenceMin` param: `z.coerce.number().min(0).max(1).optional()`

**Shared infrastructure:**
- `BRAND_PRIMARY_HEX` and `BRAND_PRIMARY_RGB` constants extracted to `chart-colours.ts` (DRY)
- `THEME_LINE_COLOURS` 8-colour palette added to `chart-colours.ts`
- All 3 theme widgets use `useDashboardFetch` and `DashboardCard` (shared patterns from Part 2)
- Dashboard grid now contains 8 widgets total (5 direct + 3 theme-derived)

---

### PRD-021 Part 2: Dashboard Layout, Navigation, and Direct Widgets — 2026-04-12

**New route and page:**
- `/dashboard` page — server component with metadata, responsive widget grid (1→2→3 columns), global filter bar
- `/api/dashboard` GET route — Zod-validated action + filter params, delegates to `executeQuery()` via RLS-protected anon client
- Dashboard is now the first item in sidebar navigation (BarChart3 icon)

**Global filter bar:**
- Client multi-select (Popover + Command with search), date range (from/to), sentiment dropdown, urgency dropdown
- All filter state encoded in URL search params (bookmarkable/shareable)
- "Clear filters" button resets all params

**Dashboard widgets (Recharts):**
- Sentiment distribution — donut PieChart (positive=green, neutral=slate, negative=red, mixed=amber), clickable segments
- Urgency distribution — BarChart (low=green, medium=amber, high=orange, critical=red), clickable bars
- Session volume over time — AreaChart with local week/month granularity toggle, CartesianGrid
- Client health grid — ScatterChart positioning clients by sentiment (X) × urgency (Y), colour-coded dots, custom tooltip
- Competitive mentions — horizontal BarChart sorted by frequency, clickable bars

**Database query service extensions:**
- 3 new actions: `sessions_over_time` (via RPC), `client_health_grid`, `competitive_mention_frequency`
- Extended `QueryFilters` with `clientIds`, `severity`, `urgency`, `granularity`
- `handleClientList()` now returns `{ id, name }` objects (was just name strings)
- `sessions_over_time` RPC function for time-bucketed GROUP BY queries

**Shared infrastructure:**
- `useDashboardFetch<T>` hook — shared fetch lifecycle across all widgets, reads URL search params for global filter reactivity, supports widget-local extra params
- `DashboardCard` component — shared card chrome with loading skeleton, error/retry, empty state, content slot
- `chart-colours.ts` — centralised sentiment and urgency hex colour maps (DRY extraction)

### PRD-021 Part 1: Theme Assignment at Extraction Time — 2026-04-12

**New tables:**
- `themes` — workspace-scoped topic-based themes with `initiated_by`, `origin` (ai/user), `is_archived`, and case-insensitive partial unique indexes for name deduplication
- `signal_themes` — many-to-many junction linking embeddings to themes, with `assigned_by` (ai/user), `confidence` score, and cascade deletes on both FKs

**AI service refactor:**
- Extracted two public generics: `callModelText()` and `callModelObject<T>()` — all non-streaming LLM calls now route through these with retry logic and error classification
- Migrated `extractSignals()`, `synthesiseMasterSignal()`, and `generateConversationTitle()` to use the new generics
- Fixed PRD-020 bug: `generateConversationTitle()` now gets 3 retries for transient failures (previously had zero)

**Theme assignment pipeline:**
- Created `theme-service.ts` with `assignSessionThemes()` — fetches workspace themes, calls LLM once per extraction, resolves/creates themes with concurrent-safe unique constraint handling, bulk inserts assignments
- Created theme assignment prompt (`lib/prompts/theme-assignment.ts`) — topic-based classification with primary/secondary theme distinction and confidence ranges
- Created Zod schema (`lib/schemas/theme-assignment-schema.ts`) for validated LLM response
- Created `ThemeRepository` and `SignalThemeRepository` interfaces with Supabase adapters

**Extraction flow wiring:**
- Modified `generateSessionEmbeddings()` to return embedding IDs (`string[]` instead of `void`) and accept `preComputedChunks`
- Wired `assignSessionThemes()` into both POST and PUT session routes, chained after embedding generation (fire-and-forget)
- Replaced all silent `.catch(() => {})` calls with dev-aware catches that emit yellow ANSI warnings in development mode

### PRD-020 Post-Part 3 Bug Fixes — 2026-04-11

**Critical: Data isolation fix**
- **Root cause:** `ChatPageContent` hardcoded `teamId = null` instead of reading from auth context; chat send route accepted `teamId` from request body (allowing client-side override); service-role client bypassed RLS for `queryDatabase` tool, exposing all users' personal workspace data when `team_id IS NULL`
- Wired `activeTeamId` from `useAuth()` context in `ChatPageContent` — chat page now respects active workspace
- Removed `teamId` from chat send request body schema — route now always reads from `active_team_id` cookie via `getActiveTeamId()`, matching all other routes
- Switched `queryDatabase` tool from service-role client to RLS-protected anon client for data isolation
- Added `filter_user_id` parameter to `match_session_embeddings` RPC function — enforces `sessions.created_by = filter_user_id` in personal workspace to prevent cross-user embedding leakage
- Updated `createEmbeddingRepository()` to accept optional `userId` parameter, passed to RPC for personal workspace scoping
- Removed `serviceClient` from `ChatStreamDeps` interface (no longer needed — anon client handles data reads, embedding repo is pre-injected)
- Removed `teamId` from `useChat` hook options and request payload

**UI fixes**
- Fixed `<!--follow-ups:...-->` HTML comment rendering in streamed messages — added `stripFollowUpBlock()` in `use-chat.ts` that strips both complete and partial follow-up blocks during streaming and from completed messages
- Changed follow-up chip clicks from auto-send to textarea insertion — added `suggestedText` prop on `ChatInput`, chips now populate textarea for user review before sending
- Fixed user message copy button invisible — added `text-foreground` on actions container to override inherited `text-primary-foreground` from user bubble
- Enabled textarea during streaming — removed `disabled={isStreaming}` so users can type ahead while response generates
- Changed chat input focus ring to `--brand-primary-light` design token
- Moved follow-up suggestion pills outside the message bubble — now rendered below the bubble in a flex column layout
- Added AI disclaimer text below chat input
- Fixed pin not re-sorting conversation list — added `sortConversations()` helper (pinned first → updatedAt desc → id desc) to optimistic update
- Replaced rename dialog with inline editing — title becomes editable in-place on "Rename" click, Enter saves, Escape cancels; deleted `rename-dialog.tsx`
- Added pinned section separator in conversation sidebar — "Pinned" label + divider between pinned and unpinned groups, hidden when no pinned conversations

### PRD-020 Part 3: Chat UI Components — 2026-04-11
- Created `app/chat/page.tsx` — thin server component with metadata, renders ChatPageContent
- Created conversation sidebar (`conversation-sidebar.tsx`, `conversation-item.tsx`, `conversation-context-menu.tsx`, `rename-dialog.tsx`) — collapsible desktop panel (280px ↔ 0) + mobile Sheet drawer, search, active/archived tabs, context menu with rename/pin/archive/delete
- Created `chat-page-content.tsx` — client coordinator wiring `useConversations` + `useChat` hooks, manages active conversation ID, sidebar collapse/mobile state, conversation creation with prepend placeholder
- Created chat area (`chat-area.tsx`, `chat-header.tsx`, `chat-input.tsx`) — header with sidebar/search toggles, auto-expanding textarea (1–6 rows) with Send/Stop buttons, archived unarchive bar
- Created message rendering (`message-bubble.tsx`, `message-thread.tsx`, `message-actions.tsx`, `memoized-markdown.tsx`) — react-virtuoso reverse mode with sentinel pattern for streaming, React.memo'd ReactMarkdown with remark-gfm, hover-visible copy actions
- Created streaming UI (`streaming-message.tsx`, `message-status-indicator.tsx`) — live markdown rendering with blinking cursor, status badges for failed/cancelled/stale with retry
- Created citations and follow-ups (`citation-chips.tsx`, `citation-preview-dialog.tsx`, `follow-up-chips.tsx`, `starter-questions.tsx`) — pill-shaped citation chips opening preview dialog, clickable follow-up question chips, 4 starter questions in empty state
- Created in-conversation search (`chat-search-bar.tsx`, `highlighted-text.tsx`) — Ctrl/Cmd+F keyboard shortcut, match count with prev/next navigation, recursive text highlighting in markdown via component overrides
- Created `use-chat.ts` — custom SSE streaming hook with AbortController cancellation, streaming state machine (idle/streaming/error)
- Created `use-conversations.ts` — dual active/archived list management with optimistic CRUD, compound cursor pagination, search filtering
- **End-of-part audit:** a11y fixes (aria-labels on sidebar clear button, aria-hidden on decorative icons), verified no dead code/import violations, TypeScript check clean

### PRD-020 Part 2: Chat Data Model and Streaming Infrastructure — 2026-04-11
- Created `conversations` and `messages` database tables with RLS (user-private conversations, derived access for messages), indexes, and auto-update triggers
- Created `lib/types/chat.ts` — `MessageRole`, `MessageStatus`, `ChatSource`, `Message`, `Conversation`, `ConversationListOptions` types
- Created `ConversationRepository` and `MessageRepository` interfaces with Supabase adapters — cursor-based pagination, pinned-first ordering for conversations, newest-first for messages
- Created `lib/services/chat-service.ts` — conversation CRUD, message CRUD, `buildContextMessages()` with 80,000-token budget (char/4 approximation)
- Created `lib/services/database-query-service.ts` — 7 predefined actions (`count_clients`, `count_sessions`, `sessions_per_client`, `sentiment_distribution`, `urgency_distribution`, `recent_sessions`, `client_list`) with team scoping via `scopeByTeam()` and shared query helpers (DRY extraction)
- Created `lib/prompts/chat-prompt.ts` — chat system prompt with tool usage instructions, citation rules, follow-up generation as `<!--follow-ups:["..."]-->` HTML comment block
- Created `lib/prompts/generate-title.ts` — lightweight 5-8 word title generation prompt
- Added `generateConversationTitle()` to `lib/services/ai-service.ts` — fire-and-forget LLM title generation, returns null on failure
- Created `lib/services/chat-stream-service.ts` — streaming orchestration: `searchInsights` and `queryDatabase` tool definitions (Vercel AI SDK v6 `tool()` + `inputSchema: zodSchema()`), `streamText()` with `stopWhen: stepCountIs(3)`, custom SSE events via `ReadableStream`, follow-up parsing, source deduplication, message finalization
- Created `lib/utils/chat-helpers.ts` — pure utility functions: `sseEvent()`, `parseFollowUps()`, `toSource()`, `deduplicateSources()`
- Created `app/api/chat/send/route.ts` — thin POST controller: auth, Zod validation, conversation create-or-resolve, message lifecycle, delegates streaming to `chat-stream-service`; returns SSE response with `X-Conversation-Id` header
- **End-of-part audit:** SRP refactor (route → stream service → helpers), DRY extraction in database-query-service (shared `baseSessionQuery`/`baseClientQuery`/`aggregateJsonField`/`extractClientName` helpers), import order fixes, TypeScript check clean

### PRD-020 Part 1: Sidebar Navigation — 2026-04-11
- Replaced top-bar header (`app-header.tsx`, `tab-nav.tsx`) with an Instagram-style hover-to-expand sidebar (`app-sidebar.tsx`) — icon-only (64px) at rest, overlay (240px) on hover, no content shift
- Created `authenticated-layout.tsx` — auth-aware layout wrapper that renders sidebar + margin for authenticated routes and footer-only for public routes
- Created `components/ui/sheet.tsx` — slide-out drawer (left/right/top/bottom) built on Radix Dialog primitives, used for mobile sidebar
- Updated `user-menu.tsx` — added `side`, `collapsed`, and `onOpenChange` props for sidebar integration; avatar wrapped in fixed-size div to prevent squishing
- Updated `workspace-switcher.tsx` — added `collapsed` and `onOpenChange` props for sidebar integration
- Added `--sidebar-width-expanded` and `--sidebar-width-collapsed` CSS custom properties to `globals.css`
- Mobile: hamburger trigger (md:hidden) opens left-side Sheet drawer with full sidebar content
- Portal-mounted dropdown collapse fix: ref-based counter (`openDropdownCount`) with 100ms grace period prevents sidebar from collapsing while dropdowns are open
- Deleted `app-header.tsx` and `tab-nav.tsx` — replaced by sidebar navigation
- Footer removed from authenticated layouts; theme toggle moved into sidebar "More" menu
- Updated `layout.tsx` — replaced AppHeader with AuthenticatedLayout wrapper
- **End-of-part audit:** TypeScript check clean (`npx tsc --noEmit`), no dead references, all 12 PRD acceptance criteria verified

### PRD-019 Part 4: Retrieval Service — 2026-04-11
- Created `lib/types/retrieval-result.ts` — `QueryClassification` union (broad/specific/comparative), `ClassificationResult`, `RetrievalOptions`, `RetrievalResult` interfaces
- Created `lib/prompts/classify-query.ts` — version-controlled system prompt and max tokens constant for lightweight LLM query classification
- Created `lib/services/retrieval-service.ts` — `retrieveRelevantChunks()` with 5-step flow: classify query (adaptive chunk count) → embed query (ephemeral, never persisted) → similarity search via repository RPC → deduplicate by exact text match → map to typed RetrievalResult[]; classification via `generateObject()` + Zod schema reusing `resolveModel()` from ai-service; classification failure falls back to broad (15 chunks); embedding/search errors propagate to caller
- Exported `resolveModel()` from `lib/services/ai-service.ts` (previously internal) for reuse by the retrieval service
- **End-of-part audit:** No fixes needed — SRP/DRY/logging/dead code/convention compliance/TypeScript strictness/framework-agnostic all clean

### PRD-019 Part 3: Embedding Pipeline — 2026-04-10
- Installed `openai` npm package for embedding API calls
- Created `lib/services/embedding-service.ts` — provider-agnostic `embedTexts()` with OpenAI adapter, batching (20 per API call, 200ms inter-batch delay), `withEmbeddingRetry()` with exponential backoff and Retry-After handling on 429, dimension validation on first call, four error classes (`EmbeddingServiceError`, `EmbeddingConfigError`, `EmbeddingRequestError`, `EmbeddingRateLimitError`)
- Created `lib/repositories/embedding-repository.ts` — `EmbeddingRepository` interface with `upsertChunks()`, `deleteBySessionId()`, `similaritySearch()` + `EmbeddingRow`, `SearchOptions`, `SimilarityResult` types
- Created `lib/repositories/supabase/supabase-embedding-repository.ts` — Supabase adapter using service-role client; similarity search via `match_session_embeddings` RPC function
- Created `docs/019-vector-search/002-match-session-embeddings-rpc.sql` — RPC function with team scoping, metadata filtering (chunk type, client name, date range), soft-delete exclusion via sessions join, configurable similarity threshold
- Created `lib/services/embedding-orchestrator.ts` — `generateSessionEmbeddings()` coordinating chunking → embedding → persistence; handles structured JSON vs raw notes fallback; deletes old embeddings on re-extraction; entire body wrapped in try/catch for fire-and-forget usage
- Wired fire-and-forget embedding into `POST /api/sessions` (embed on create) and `PUT /api/sessions/[id]` (re-embed on every update with `isReExtraction: true`)
- Updated `.env.example` with `EMBEDDING_PROVIDER`, `EMBEDDING_MODEL`, `EMBEDDING_DIMENSIONS`
- Updated `lib/repositories/index.ts` and `lib/repositories/supabase/index.ts` with embedding repository re-exports
- **End-of-part audit:** Fixed dead `EmbeddingRateLimitError` class — wired into retry exhaustion on 429; fixed import ordering in both session route files; updated ARCHITECTURE.md (new files in file map, embedding env vars in env table, updated Current State)

### PRD-019 Part 2: Chunking Logic — 2026-04-10
- Created `lib/types/embedding-chunk.ts` — `ChunkType` union (10 chunk types), `EmbeddingChunk` interface, `SessionMeta` interface
- Created `lib/services/chunking-service.ts` — pure `chunkStructuredSignals()` producing typed chunks from all `ExtractedSignals` sections (summary, client profile, pain points, requirements, aspirations, competitive mentions, blockers, tools & platforms, custom categories) with snake_case metadata and null-value omission; pure `chunkRawNotes()` splitting raw notes by paragraph for raw-only sessions
- **End-of-part audit:** No fixes needed — SRP/DRY/dead code/convention compliance/TypeScript strictness/purity all clean

### PRD-019 Part 1: pgvector Setup and Embeddings Table — 2026-04-10
- Enabled `pgvector` extension on the Supabase instance (`CREATE EXTENSION IF NOT EXISTS vector`)
- Created `session_embeddings` table with columns: `id`, `session_id` (FK → sessions, ON DELETE CASCADE), `team_id` (FK → teams, nullable), `chunk_text`, `chunk_type` (text), `metadata` (jsonb), `embedding` (vector(1536)), `schema_version`, `created_at`
- Created HNSW index on `embedding` column (`vector_cosine_ops`) for cosine similarity search
- Created composite indexes on `(session_id)` and `(team_id, chunk_type)` for cascade deletes and filtered searches
- Enabled RLS with 8 policies (personal + team for SELECT/INSERT/UPDATE/DELETE) mirroring `sessions` table pattern via `is_team_member()`
- Updated ARCHITECTURE.md — added `session_embeddings` to Data Model section, database tables list, and docs file map

### PRD-018 Part 2: Switch UI to Render from JSON — 2026-04-10
- Created `components/capture/structured-signal-view.tsx` — renders `ExtractedSignals` JSON as typed UI with discrete sections (summary, sentiment, urgency, decision timeline, client profile, pain points, requirements, aspirations, competitive mentions, blockers, platforms & channels, custom categories); severity/priority/sentiment/urgency badges using design tokens; client quote formatting; empty-state handling
- Updated `structured-notes-panel.tsx` — branches between `StructuredSignalView` (when `structuredJson` is present) and `MarkdownPanel` fallback (pre-Part 1 sessions); edit toggle switches from JSON view to markdown editor for manual edits; added `showHeading` and `className` props
- Wired `structuredJson` into `session-capture-form.tsx` — passes hook state to `StructuredNotesPanel`
- Wired `StructuredNotesPanel` into `expanded-session-row.tsx` — replaced inline `MarkdownPanel` with panel; resolves JSON from hook state (fresh extraction) or session prop (DB); added `structured_json` to frontend `SessionRow` interface
- **End-of-part audit:** Fixed `text-white` hardcode → `text-primary-foreground` in urgency critical badge; added `className` prop to `StructuredNotesPanel`; fixed import order in `structured-notes-panel.tsx`; updated ARCHITECTURE.md (added `structured-signal-view.tsx` to file map, updated `structured-notes-panel.tsx` description)

### PRD-018 Part 1: Structured Output Migration — Core Schema & Extraction — 2026-04-10
- Created `lib/schemas/extraction-schema.ts` — Zod schema for structured signal extraction output with `EXTRACTION_SCHEMA_VERSION`, `.describe()` annotations for LLM guidance, and exported types (`ExtractedSignals`, `SignalChunk`, `RequirementChunk`, `CompetitiveMention`, `ToolAndPlatform`, `CustomCategory`)
- Created `lib/utils/render-extracted-signals-to-markdown.ts` — converts `ExtractedSignals` JSON to markdown matching the original extraction prompt output format for backward compatibility
- Created `lib/prompts/structured-extraction.ts` — system prompt and user message builder for `generateObject()` extraction; custom user prompts appended as guidance in the user message, not the system prompt
- Migrated `extractSignals()` in `ai-service.ts` from `generateText()` to `generateObject()` with `extractionSchema`; derives markdown via `renderExtractedSignalsToMarkdown()` for the `structured_notes` column
- Extracted `withRetry<T>()` generic helper in `ai-service.ts` — shared retry logic with error classification used by both `callModel()` and `callModelObject()`
- Added `structured_json` (JSONB, nullable) column to `sessions` table; updated `SessionRow`, `SessionInsert`, `SessionUpdate` in repository interface, Supabase adapter, and mock adapter
- Extended `Session`, `CreateSessionInput`, `UpdateSessionInput` in session-service with `structured_json` passthrough; `updateSession()` handles extraction vs manual-edit vs input-change scenarios for JSON column
- Updated `POST /api/ai/extract-signals` response to include `structuredJson`
- Updated `POST /api/sessions` and `PUT /api/sessions/[id]` to accept and pass through `structuredJson` (Zod `z.record(z.string(), z.unknown())`)
- Extended `useSignalExtraction` hook to store and expose `structuredJson` from extraction API response
- Updated `SessionCaptureForm` and `ExpandedSessionRow` to pass `structuredJson` through to session save (PUT only sends JSON when `isExtraction: true`)
- Used array-of-objects for `custom` field instead of `z.record()` to avoid OpenAI structured output `propertyNames` restriction
- **End-of-part audit:** SRP/DRY acceptable (renderer helpers and callModel/callModelObject diverge enough to justify separation); no dead code; import order fix in ai-service.ts; updated ARCHITECTURE.md (added `structured_json` to data model, new files to file map, updated ai-service and Key Design Decisions descriptions)

### PRD-014 Part 4: Staleness Indicators & Re-extraction Warnings — 2026-04-08
- Added `structured_notes_edited` column (boolean, default false) to `sessions` table — distinguishes manual-edit staleness from input-change staleness
- Extended `SessionRow`, `SessionUpdate`, and `Session` interfaces (repository + service) with `structured_notes_edited`; updated Supabase and mock adapters
- Enhanced staleness state machine in `updateSession()`: fresh extraction resets both flags; manual structured notes edits set `structured_notes_edited = true`; input-only changes preserve existing `structured_notes_edited` value
- Added staleness warning badge ("Extraction may be outdated") in expanded session row — amber `--status-warning` token, visually distinct from prompt version badge
- Added subtle `AlertTriangle` warning icon in collapsed table row next to Sparkles icon when `extraction_stale = true`
- Enhanced `ReextractConfirmDialog` with `hasManualEdits` prop — context-aware warning text distinguishing manual edit loss from standard re-extraction
- Added `forceConfirmOnReextract` option to `useSignalExtraction` hook — bridges server-side `structured_notes_edited` flag into client-side re-extract confirmation flow
- Created `GET /api/sessions/prompt-versions` endpoint — returns distinct prompt version IDs with computed version numbers and `hasNull` flag for pre-migration sessions
- Added `getDistinctPromptVersionIds()` to `SessionRepository` interface, Supabase adapter, and mock adapter
- Added `promptVersionId` and `promptVersionNull` filter params to `SessionListFilters`, Supabase list query, `SessionFilters` service type, and `GET /api/sessions` Zod schema
- Created `PromptVersionFilter` component — dropdown populated from prompt-versions endpoint with "All versions", "Prompt vN", and "Default prompt" options
- Wired `PromptVersionFilter` into `SessionFilters` component and `PastSessionsTable` API call
- Added "Last edited by" field to `ExpandedSessionMetadata` — resolves `updated_by` email in team context alongside `created_by` emails in a single batch query
- Added `updated_by_email` to `SessionWithClient` service interface and frontend `SessionRow` interface
- **End-of-part audit:** All P4.R1–P4.R8 requirements verified; no SRP/DRY/dead code/design token violations found; updated ARCHITECTURE.md (added `structured_notes_edited` to data model, `prompt-versions/route.ts` and `prompt-version-filter.tsx` to file map, updated current state and component descriptions)

### PRD-014 Part 3: Show Prompt Version in Past Sessions — 2026-04-08
- Created `GET /api/prompts/[id]` endpoint — fetches a single prompt version by UUID with computed version number (1-based, ordered by `created_at` ascending); Zod UUID validation, auth check, 400/401/404/500 responses with logging
- Added `findById()` method to `PromptRepository` interface and Supabase adapter — fetches a prompt version without team scoping (cross-scope traceability for historical versions)
- Added `getPromptVersionById()` wrapper in prompt-service
- Created `PromptVersionBadge` component — clickable badge in expanded session row that fetches prompt content on click, caches the result, and opens `ViewPromptDialog` with "Extraction Prompt — Version {n}" title
- Added `prompt_version_id` to frontend `SessionRow` interface; conditional badge render when non-null
- **Bug fix:** `useSignalExtraction` hook now captures and exposes `promptVersionId` from the extraction API response; `session-capture-form` (POST) and `expanded-session-row` (PUT) now pass `promptVersionId` to session save — previously the value was discarded and never stored
- Expanded session row PUT now also sends `isExtraction` and `inputChanged` flags to support the backend staleness state machine
- **End-of-part audit:** Removed unused `className` prop from `PromptVersionBadgeProps`; verified P3.R1–P3.R6 compliance; updated ARCHITECTURE.md file map (added `prompts/[id]/route.ts`, `prompt-version-badge.tsx`), hook description, and current state

### PRD-014 Part 2: View Prompt on Capture Page — 2026-04-08
- Created `ViewPromptDialog` component — reusable read-only dialog that fetches the active extraction prompt on open, renders it as markdown, includes "Edit in Settings" footer link, handles loading/error states; designed for Part 3 reuse via optional `content` prop
- Added "View Prompt" button (`ai-outline` variant) to capture form between Extract Signals and Save Session buttons
- Added `ai-outline` button variant to `button.tsx` — gold border/text with subtle gold hover background
- Extracted `PROSE_CLASSES` constant to `lib/utils.ts` — shared Tailwind prose classes now used by `ViewPromptDialog`, `MarkdownPanel`, and `MasterSignalContent` (DRY fix, 3 files consolidated)
- **End-of-part audit:** Removed unused `Eye` import and commented-out wrapper div from `view-prompt-dialog.tsx`; extracted shared prose classes; updated ARCHITECTURE.md file map, utils description, and current state

### PRD-014 Part 1: Session Traceability & Staleness Data Model — 2026-04-08
- Added `prompt_version_id` (UUID, nullable FK → prompt_versions), `extraction_stale` (boolean, default false), and `updated_by` (UUID, nullable FK → auth.users) columns to the `sessions` table
- Added partial index `sessions_prompt_version_id_idx` on `prompt_version_id` for future prompt version filtering (P4.R7)
- Extended `SessionRow`, `SessionInsert`, `SessionUpdate` interfaces and all repository adapters (Supabase + mock) with the three new fields
- Added `getActiveVersion()` method to `PromptRepository` interface and Supabase adapter — returns full `PromptVersionRow` (not just content) for traceability
- Added `markStale()` method to `SessionRepository` interface and adapters — lightweight staleness update for attachment add/remove flows
- Changed `extractSignals()` return type from `string` to `ExtractionResult` (`{ structuredNotes, promptVersionId }`) — API response now includes the prompt version ID used (P1.R6)
- Added `getActivePromptVersion()` to prompt-service — wraps the new repo method for the AI service layer
- Implemented staleness state machine in `updateSession()`: fresh extraction resets stale (P1.R5/R9), clearing structured notes clears both (P1.R8), input changes or manual edits mark stale (P1.R4)
- Added `isExtraction`, `inputChanged`, `promptVersionId` fields to PUT `/api/sessions/[id]` schema and `promptVersionId` to POST `/api/sessions`
- Attachment upload and delete routes now call `markStale()` to flag extraction staleness on attachment changes (P1.R4)
- Sessions list API (`GET /api/sessions`) includes all three new fields in the response (P1.R13)
- **End-of-part audit:** Removed unused `SessionAccessRow` import from session-service.ts; verified all P1.R1–R13 requirements traced to implementation; updated ARCHITECTURE.md data model and current state

### PRD-015 Part 1: Public Landing Page — 2026-04-07
- Added public landing page at `/` with hero section (gradient headline, pill badge, dual CTAs), 4-card feature grid, 3-step "How It Works" flow, and bottom CTA
- Features defined as a data array for easy extension as new capabilities ship
- Authenticated users auto-redirect to `/capture` with no flash of landing page
- Updated middleware to allow unauthenticated access to `/`
- Updated `AppHeader` and `AppFooter` to hide on the landing page (footer converted to client component for `usePathname` access)
- Landing page renders its own lightweight nav (logo + Get Started) and minimal footer (copyright + sign-in link)
- All styling uses existing CSS custom properties and Tailwind tokens — no new dependencies

### PRD-012 Backlog: Polish fixes — 2026-04-07
- Added missing entry logs to 3 GET route handlers (`/api/teams`, `/api/teams/[teamId]`, `/api/teams/[teamId]/members`) for logging consistency
- Extracted `TableShell` and `TableHeadCell` into `components/settings/table-shell.tsx` — shared bordered table wrapper used by `team-members-table` and `pending-invitations-table`, normalised to design tokens
- Extracted `ConfirmDialog` into `components/ui/confirm-dialog.tsx` — reusable config-driven confirmation dialog (title, description, destructive variant, loading state); replaces inline implementation in `team-members-table.tsx`
- Updated PRD-012 status to Complete; checked off all acceptance criteria across Parts 1–5; updated TRD status

### PRD-012 Part 5: Dependency Inversion — Injectable Data-Access Layer — 2026-04-07
- Introduced repository pattern: 8 interfaces in `lib/repositories/` defining data-access contracts (SessionRepository, ClientRepository, TeamRepository, MasterSignalRepository, InvitationRepository, PromptRepository, ProfileRepository, AttachmentRepository)
- Created Supabase adapter implementations in `lib/repositories/supabase/` — one per interface, instantiated via factory functions (`createSessionRepository`, `createClientRepository`, etc.)
- Extracted `scopeByTeam()` helper in `lib/repositories/supabase/scope-by-team.ts` — centralises workspace scoping logic (12+ occurrences DRY'd into one function)
- Moved `SessionNotFoundRepoError` from Supabase adapter to `session-repository.ts` interface file — eliminates service-layer coupling to the Supabase implementation
- Refactored all 8 data-access services to accept injected repository parameters instead of importing from `@/lib/supabase/server` — zero Supabase imports remain in `lib/services/`
- Updated all 21 API route handlers to create Supabase clients, instantiate repositories via factories, and pass them to services
- Created `MockSessionRepository` in `lib/repositories/mock/` — in-memory implementation demonstrating that services work with non-Supabase backends
- **End-of-PRD audit (PRD-012 complete):** Full SRP/DRY/dead-code/convention sweep across all Parts 1–5; updated ARCHITECTURE.md file map, service descriptions, key design decisions, and workspace context flow

### PRD-012 Part 4: API Route and Service Layer Cleanup — 2026-04-07
- Moved `SignalSession` type from `master-signal-service.ts` to `lib/types/signal-session.ts` — fixes dependency direction (prompts layer no longer imports from services)
- Extracted `generateOrUpdateMasterSignal()` orchestration into `master-signal-service.ts` with discriminated union return (`GenerateResult`), reducing `generate-master-signal/route.ts` from 173 → 68 lines
- Extracted `getTeamMembersWithProfiles()` and `getTeamsWithRolesForUser()` into `team-service.ts`, simplifying `teams/[teamId]/members/route.ts` (83 → 49 lines) and `teams/route.ts` GET handler
- Moved `checkSessionAccess()` from `app/api/sessions/_helpers.ts` to `session-service.ts` with discriminated union return (`SessionAccessResult`); created shared `mapAccessError()` in `lib/utils/map-access-error.ts`; deleted `_helpers.ts`
- Added Zod validation to `GET /api/clients` (`clientSearchSchema`) and `GET /api/prompts` (`promptQuerySchema`), replacing manual `VALID_PROMPT_KEYS` array with shared `PROMPT_KEYS` const used by both GET and POST schemas
- All route handlers now follow the pattern: auth → validate → service call → map result to HTTP response. No route contains inline Supabase queries for business logic.

### PRD-012 Part 3: SRP — Component Decomposition — 2026-04-07
- Extracted `SessionTableRow` + `formatDate`, `truncateNotes`, `formatEmail` helpers from `past-sessions-table.tsx` into `session-table-row.tsx` (past-sessions-table 401 → 298 lines)
- Split `expanded-session-row.tsx` (493 lines) into thin coordinator + 3 presentational subcomponents: `expanded-session-metadata.tsx` (73), `expanded-session-notes.tsx` (111), `expanded-session-actions.tsx` (118) — coordinator reduced to 349 lines with signals panel kept inline per design decision
- Split `session-capture-form.tsx` (315 lines) into coordinator + 2 subcomponents: `capture-attachment-section.tsx` (60), `structured-notes-panel.tsx` (27) — coordinator reduced to 286 lines
- Split `master-signal-page-content.tsx` (330 lines) into coordinator + hook + 3 subcomponents: `use-master-signal.ts` (170), `master-signal-status-banner.tsx` (74), `master-signal-empty-state.tsx` (76), `master-signal-content.tsx` (44) — coordinator reduced to 107 lines
- Split `prompt-editor-page-content.tsx` (497 lines) into coordinator + hook + 2 subcomponents: `use-prompt-editor.ts` (358), `prompt-master-signal-notice.tsx` (54), `prompt-unsaved-dialog.tsx` (50) — coordinator reduced to 144 lines
- All new presentational components are pure renderers with no side effects; hooks own state + logic; coordinators compose children

### PRD-012 Part 2: DRY — Shared Utilities and Patterns — 2026-04-07
- Created `lib/cookies/active-team.ts` — single source of truth for client-side `active_team_id` cookie operations (`getActiveTeamId`, `setActiveTeamCookie`, `clearActiveTeamCookie`), replacing 7+ inline implementations
- Added reactive `activeTeamId` and `setActiveTeam()` to AuthProvider context — workspace switching now updates React state instead of calling `window.location.reload()`, enabling reactive data refetching across all consuming components
- Extracted `fetchCanCreateTeam` helper within `auth-provider.tsx` — deduplicated profile query used by both auth paths
- Created `lib/hooks/use-signal-extraction.ts` — shared extraction state machine hook (`ExtractionState`, re-extract confirmation flow, `resetExtraction`) consumed by `session-capture-form.tsx` and `expanded-session-row.tsx`
- Created `components/capture/reextract-confirm-dialog.tsx` — shared presentational re-extract confirmation dialog
- Created `components/auth/auth-form-shell.tsx` — shared centered auth card layout (`title`, `subtitle`, `children`), replacing 4× duplicated full-screen centering markup in login, signup, forgot-password, and reset-password forms
- Created `components/auth/email-confirmation-panel.tsx` — shared "Check your email" success panel (`children`, `linkText`, `linkHref`), replacing 2× duplicated confirmation UI in signup and forgot-password forms
- Created `lib/utils/map-ai-error.ts` — `mapAIErrorToResponse()` shared AI error-to-HTTP mapper handling 5 error types + unexpected fallback, replacing 2× duplicated ~70-line catch blocks in `extract-signals/route.ts` and `generate-master-signal/route.ts`
- Created `components/settings/role-picker.tsx` — controlled `RolePicker` component with exported `Role` type, replacing 3× duplicated role select + type definitions in `invite-single-form.tsx`, `invite-bulk-dialog.tsx`, and `pending-invitations-table.tsx`

### PRD-012 Part 1: Design Tokens and Typography — 2026-04-07
- Added 14 status colour tokens (`--status-error`, `--status-success`, `--status-warning`, `--status-info` with `-light`, `-border`, `-text` variants) and 4 AI action tokens (`--ai-action`, `--ai-action-foreground`, `--ai-action-hover`, `--ai-action-light`) to `globals.css` using oklch colour space
- Added `ai` button variant (warm gold) to `button.tsx` CVA config
- Applied `variant="ai"` to Extract Signals, Re-extract Signals, and Generate Master Signal buttons
- Replaced all hardcoded Tailwind status colours (`text-red-500`, `bg-red-50`, `bg-green-50`, `text-green-500`, `bg-amber-*`, `text-amber-*`, `bg-blue-*`, `text-blue-*`) with CSS custom property tokens across 14 files
- Migrated `invite-shell.tsx` StatusIcon colour map from hardcoded Tailwind classes to token references
- Replaced `window.location.href = "/capture"` with `router.push("/capture")` in `login-form.tsx` and `reset-password-form.tsx`
- Replaced all `text-[10px]` arbitrary font sizes with `text-xs` across 5 files

### PRD-013 Part 4: Edge Cases & Limits — 2026-04-06
- Replaced hardcoded `.max(50000)` with `MAX_COMBINED_CHARS` constant in `extract-signals/route.ts`, `sessions/route.ts`, `sessions/[id]/route.ts`, and `session-capture-form.tsx` — server and client now reference the same shared limit
- Added input length logging to the extract-signals route before AI calls

### PRD-013 UI Polish — 2026-04-06
- Made the entire file upload zone clickable (not just the "browse" link) — added `onClick` on the container div, `cursor-pointer` styling, and hover feedback
- Moved the attachments section (upload zone, saved/pending lists, character counter) below raw notes inside the left column of the expanded session row grid
- Made saved attachment rows fully clickable to toggle expand/collapse — added `e.stopPropagation()` on download/delete buttons to prevent unintended toggles

### Bug Fix: PDF Parsing — 2026-04-06
- Downgraded `pdf-parse` from v2.4.5 to v1.1.1 — v2 depends on `DOMMatrix` and other browser APIs unavailable in Vercel's serverless runtime
- Fixed import to `pdf-parse/lib/pdf-parse` to bypass v1's test-file-loading entrypoint (`ENOENT: ./test/data/05-versions-space.pdf`)
- Removed `@types/pdf-parse` (v2 types); added custom type declaration in `types/pdf-parse.d.ts`

### Docs: Storage Bucket Name Correction — 2026-04-06
- Updated ARCHITECTURE.md, CHANGELOG.md, PRD-013, and TRD-013 to reference the actual Supabase Storage bucket name (`SYNTHESISER_FILE_UPLOAD`) instead of the previously documented `session-attachments`

### PRD-013 Part 3: Past Sessions — Attachment Display & Management — 2026-04-02
- Added `attachment_count` to `SessionWithClient` with batch-fetch in `getSessions()` — displays paperclip icon with count in collapsed session rows
- Created `GET /api/sessions/[id]/attachments` — returns non-deleted attachments for a session
- Created `GET /api/sessions/[id]/attachments/[attachmentId]/download` — generates signed download URL
- Created `saved-attachment-list.tsx` — displays persisted attachments with download, delete (with confirmation when signals exist), and view parsed content toggle
- Updated `expanded-session-row.tsx` — full attachment management: fetch saved attachments on mount, upload new via `FileUploadZone`, delete existing, compose AI input from all attachments, two-step save flow
- Relaxed `PUT /api/sessions/[id]` validation to allow empty `rawNotes` when `hasAttachments` is true
- **Code quality audit:**
  - Extracted `FILE_ICONS` to `lib/constants/file-icons.ts` — shared by `attachment-list.tsx` and `saved-attachment-list.tsx`
  - Extracted `composeAIInput()` to `lib/utils/compose-ai-input.ts` — shared by `session-capture-form.tsx` and `expanded-session-row.tsx`
  - Extracted `uploadAttachmentsToSession()` to `lib/utils/upload-attachments.ts` — shared by `session-capture-form.tsx` and `expanded-session-row.tsx`
  - Renamed `checkSessionWriteAccess` → `checkSessionAccess` — accurately reflects its use for both read and write operations

### PRD-013 Part 2: Persistence & Signal Extraction Integration — 2026-04-02
- Created `session_attachments` table with RLS (personal + team-scoped) and `SYNTHESISER_FILE_UPLOAD` Storage bucket
- Created `lib/services/attachment-service.ts` — `uploadAndCreateAttachment`, `getAttachmentsBySessionId`, `deleteAttachment` (soft-delete DB + hard-delete Storage), `getSignedDownloadUrl`, `getAttachmentCountForSession`
- Created `POST /api/sessions/[id]/attachments` — multipart upload endpoint with file size/type/count validation
- Created `DELETE /api/sessions/[id]/attachments/[attachmentId]` — soft-delete attachment + hard-delete from Storage
- Updated `POST /api/sessions` — relaxed `rawNotes` to allow empty when `hasAttachments` is true
- Updated `session-capture-form.tsx` — two-step save flow (save session JSON → upload attachments via multipart)
- Updated `attachment-list.tsx` — added "View content" toggle showing parsed text read-only
- Extracted `checkSessionWriteAccess` shared helper to `app/api/sessions/_helpers.ts` — eliminates duplicated auth/permission checks across `[id]/route.ts`, attachments POST, and attachments DELETE routes
- Extracted `formatFileSize` to `lib/utils/format-file-size.ts` — shared by `file-upload-zone.tsx` and `attachment-list.tsx`
- Removed unused `getActiveTeamId` import from `attachment-service.ts`

### PRD-013 Part 1: File Upload Infrastructure — 2026-04-02
- Created `lib/constants.ts` with file upload limits (`MAX_FILE_SIZE_BYTES`, `MAX_COMBINED_CHARS`, `MAX_ATTACHMENTS`, `ACCEPTED_FILE_TYPES`, `ACCEPTED_EXTENSIONS`)
- Created `lib/services/file-parser-service.ts` with parsers for TXT, PDF, CSV, DOCX, JSON files and WhatsApp/Slack chat format detection and restructuring
- Created `POST /api/files/parse` stateless API route — accepts `multipart/form-data`, validates file, returns parsed content with `source_format`
- Created `file-upload-zone.tsx` — drag-and-drop upload zone with inline validation, multi-file support, and server-side parse calls
- Created `attachment-list.tsx` — displays attached files with type icon, size, format badge, and remove button
- Integrated file attachments into `session-capture-form.tsx` — combined character counter (notes + attachments vs 50k limit), composed AI input merges raw notes with attachment content, attachments sent in save payload, form reset clears attachments
- Installed `pdf-parse`, `mammoth`, `papaparse` npm packages with TypeScript type definitions

### PRD-011: Email + Password Authentication — 2026-04-02
- **Part 1 — Sign-Up & Sign-In:** Created `/signup` page with email/password form (Zod validation: 8+ chars, 1 digit, 1 special char), email confirmation flow via Supabase, and Google OAuth button. Updated `/login` with email/password form alongside existing Google OAuth. Added shared `PasswordInput` component (toggleable show/hide) and `passwordField` Zod schema in `lib/schemas/password-schema.ts`. Created `GoogleIcon` shared component.
- **Part 2 — Password Reset:** Created `/forgot-password` page (sends reset email via `supabase.auth.resetPasswordForEmail` with `type=recovery` redirect). Created `/reset-password` page (new password + confirm, calls `supabase.auth.updateUser`). Auth callback handles `type=recovery` and redirects to reset page.
- **Part 3 — Invite Flow:** Updated `/invite/[token]` with four states: authenticated + email match (accept card), authenticated + mismatch (warning + sign-out option), unauthenticated + existing user (sign-in form with pre-filled email), unauthenticated + new user (sign-up form with pre-filled email). Email match verification in auth callback prevents wrong-account acceptance. Created `invite-sign-in-form.tsx`, `invite-sign-up-form.tsx`, `invite-accept-card.tsx`, `invite-mismatch-card.tsx`, `invite-shell.tsx`, `invite-helpers.ts`.
- **Part 4 — Middleware:** Added `/signup`, `/forgot-password`, and `/invite/*` to public routes. `/reset-password` requires authentication (user arrives via recovery link which establishes session). Authenticated users redirected away from auth pages to `/capture`.

### Workspace Switcher: Always Visible + Create Team in Dropdown — 2026-04-02
- Workspace switcher now renders for all authenticated users (not just those with teams)
- Shows a skeleton shimmer while loading instead of disappearing
- "Create Team" option moved inside the dropdown (gated by `canCreateTeam`)
- Non-paid users see a disabled "Team workspaces — contact us" hint (passive CTA)
- Standalone "Create Team" button removed from app header
- `CreateTeamDialog` converted to controlled component (`open`/`onOpenChange` props)
- Fixed `router.refresh()` → `window.location.reload()` in both workspace switcher and create team dialog

### Email Provider: Add Brevo Adapter — 2026-04-02
- Added Brevo adapter to `email-service.ts` using `@getbrevo/brevo` SDK
- `EMAIL_PROVIDER` now supports `resend` and `brevo` — switch via env var
- Added `BREVO_API_KEY` env var; only the active provider's key is required
- Added `parseFromAddress()` helper to extract name/email from `EMAIL_FROM` format
- Resend adapter unchanged

### PRD-010 Part 7: Team Management — Members, Roles, and Ownership — 2026-04-02
- Added team management service functions: `renameTeam`, `deleteTeam`, `removeMember`, `changeMemberRole`, `transferOwnership`, `leaveTeam` (with `LeaveBlockedError`)
- Created API routes: `GET/PATCH/DELETE /api/teams/[teamId]`, `GET /api/teams/[teamId]/members`, `DELETE /api/teams/[teamId]/members/[userId]`, `PATCH /api/teams/[teamId]/members/[userId]/role`, `POST /api/teams/[teamId]/transfer`, `POST /api/teams/[teamId]/leave`
- Owner can rename/delete team, remove any member, change roles, transfer ownership
- Admin can remove sales members; sales have no management actions (except leave)
- Owner leaving auto-transfers ownership to the oldest admin; blocked if no other admins exist
- Created `team-members-table.tsx`: member list with contextual actions (remove, role change, transfer, leave) and confirmation dialogs
- Created `team-danger-zone.tsx`: rename input + delete button with type-to-confirm safety dialog (owner only)
- Updated `team-settings.tsx` to integrate members table and danger zone
- Updated `settings-page-content.tsx` to resolve and pass `ownerId`, `isOwner` to team settings

### PRD-010 Part 6: Team-Scoped Master Signal and Prompts — 2026-04-02
- Scoped all `master-signal-service.ts` functions by `team_id` via `getActiveTeamId()`: `getLatestMasterSignal`, `getStaleSessionCount`, `getAllSignalSessions`, `getSignalSessionsSince`, `saveMasterSignal`
- Scoped all `prompt-service.ts` functions by `team_id`: `getActivePrompt`, `getPromptHistory`, `savePromptVersion` (deactivation scoped to workspace)
- Added admin role check to `POST /api/ai/generate-master-signal` and `POST /api/prompts` in team context (403 for sales)
- Master signal page hides generate button for non-admin team members, shows info banner
- Prompt editor accepts `readOnly` prop — sales members see prompts in view-only mode with info banner
- `VersionHistoryPanel` and `VersionViewDialog` hide revert buttons when `onRevert` is not provided
- `SettingsPageContent` passes `readOnly` for non-admin team members

### PRD-010 Part 5: Team-Scoped Data — Sessions and Clients — 2026-04-02
- Scoped `getSessions` and `createSession` by `team_id` via `getActiveTeamId()` in `session-service.ts`
- Scoped `searchClients` and `createNewClient` by `team_id` in `client-service.ts`
- `taintLatestMasterSignal` accepts optional `teamId` for team-scoped tainting
- `deleteSession` passes `team_id` to taint function
- Added `checkTeamSessionPermission` to `PUT/DELETE /api/sessions/[id]` — sales can only modify own sessions, admins can modify any
- Added "Captured by" column in past sessions table (team context only, shows email local part)
- `SessionRow` interface includes `created_by` and `created_by_email`
- `ExpandedSessionRow` accepts `canEdit` — read-only view with "View only" message for non-permitted users
- `MarkdownPanel` accepts `readOnly` prop to hide edit toggle
- Resolved creator emails via `profiles` table in `getSessions` for team attribution

### PRD-010 Part 4: Workspace Switcher and Context Management — 2026-04-02
- Added `getActiveTeamId()` to `lib/supabase/server.ts` for reading the `active_team_id` cookie server-side
- Middleware validates `active_team_id` cookie on every request — clears if user is no longer a team member
- Created `workspace-switcher.tsx`: dropdown showing Personal + all teams with roles, sets/clears cookie on switch
- Integrated workspace switcher into `app-header.tsx` (visible only when user has team memberships)
- Created `GET /api/teams` route to list user's teams with roles

### PRD-010 Part 3: Invite Acceptance and Join Flow — 2026-04-02
- Created `/invite/[token]` server page with `InvitePageContent` client component
- Handles four states: valid (join), expired, already accepted, invalid — with appropriate UI for each
- Authenticated users see "Accept & Join Team" button (calls `POST /api/invite/[token]/accept`)
- Unauthenticated users see "Sign in with Google to join" (sets `pending_invite_token` cookie, redirects through OAuth)
- Auth callback (`/auth/callback`) checks for `pending_invite_token` cookie, auto-accepts invitation and sets `active_team_id`
- Added `getInvitationByToken` and `acceptInvitation` to `invitation-service.ts` (service role client for RLS bypass)
- Middleware allows `/invite` as a public route

### PRD-010 Part 2: Team Creation and Invite Flow — 2026-04-02
- Created `team-service.ts` with `createTeam`, `getTeamsForUser`, `getTeamById`, `getTeamMember`, `getActiveTeamMembers`
- Created `invitation-service.ts` with `createInvitations`, `getPendingInvitations`, `revokeInvitation`, `resendInvitation`
- Created invite email template in `lib/email-templates/invite-email.ts`
- Created API routes: `POST /api/teams`, `GET/POST /api/teams/[teamId]/invitations`, `DELETE/POST .../[invitationId]`, `.../[invitationId]/resend`
- Created `create-team-dialog.tsx` for team creation (visible when `can_create_team = true`)
- Created `team-settings.tsx`, `invite-single-form.tsx`, `invite-bulk-dialog.tsx`, `pending-invitations-table.tsx`
- Created `settings-page-content.tsx` wrapping prompt editor and team settings in tabs (admin only)

### PRD-010 Part 1: Database Schema and Email Service — 2026-04-02
- Created `teams`, `team_members`, `team_invitations` tables with RLS policies
- Added `can_create_team` to `profiles` table
- Added nullable `team_id` column to `sessions`, `clients`, `master_signals`, `prompt_versions`
- Created helper functions: `is_team_member()`, `get_team_role()`, `is_team_admin()` (SECURITY DEFINER)
- Created provider-agnostic `email-service.ts` with `sendEmail()`, `resolveEmailProvider()`, Resend adapter
- Added `EMAIL_PROVIDER`, `RESEND_API_KEY`, `EMAIL_FROM` env vars

### PRD-009 Part 1: AI Provider Abstraction — 2026-04-02
- Replaced `@anthropic-ai/sdk` with the Vercel AI SDK (`ai`, `@ai-sdk/anthropic`, `@ai-sdk/openai`, `@ai-sdk/google`)
- Replaced `callClaude()` with provider-agnostic `callModel()` using `generateText()` from the Vercel AI SDK
- Added `resolveModel()` factory that reads `AI_PROVIDER` and `AI_MODEL` env vars and returns the correct SDK model instance
- Supports Anthropic, OpenAI, and Google providers at launch — switching is a one-line env var change
- Replaced Anthropic-specific error class checks with generic `APICallError` status code inspection for retry logic
- Replaced `CLAUDE_MODEL` env var with `AI_PROVIDER` + `AI_MODEL`
- Public API (`extractSignals`, `synthesiseMasterSignal`) unchanged — no caller modifications
- Updated `.env.example`, `ARCHITECTURE.md`, `CLAUDE.md`

### PRD-008 Part 3: Remove Admin Role System — 2026-04-02
- Removed admin gate from Settings page — all authenticated users can access `/settings` and customise their prompts
- Settings tab now visible in navigation for all users
- Removed `isCurrentUserAdmin()` checks from `GET /api/prompts` and `POST /api/prompts` — access control handled by RLS
- Removed `isAdmin` from `AuthProvider` context and `AuthContextValue` interface
- Deleted `lib/hooks/use-profile.ts` (only fetched the admin flag)
- Removed `isCurrentUserAdmin()` from `profile-service.ts` — `getCurrentProfile()` retained
- `is_admin` column on `profiles` and `is_admin()` SQL function retained in database for potential future use

### PRD-008 Part 2: Per-User Data Isolation — 2026-04-02
- Added `created_by` column to `clients` table with per-user RLS policies and unique index `(LOWER(name), created_by)`
- Updated RLS policies on `sessions` — SELECT and UPDATE now scoped to `created_by = auth.uid()`
- Updated RLS policy on `master_signals` — SELECT now scoped to `created_by = auth.uid()`
- Added `created_by` column to `prompt_versions` table with per-user RLS policies and unique index `(prompt_key, created_by)`
- `taintLatestMasterSignal` now accepts a `userId` parameter to target the correct user's master signal
- `deleteSession` passes the session's `created_by` to the taint function
- `getActivePrompt` and `savePromptVersion` switched from service role client to user-scoped `createClient()` — RLS handles per-user scoping
- System-seeded prompt rows (`created_by = NULL`) are no longer visible via RLS; users fall back to hardcoded defaults

### PRD-008 Part 1: Remove Email Domain Restriction — 2026-04-02
- Removed `ALLOWED_EMAIL_DOMAIN` environment variable and email domain check from the OAuth callback — any Google account can now sign in
- Simplified `app/auth/callback/route.ts` — after successful code exchange, redirects straight to `/capture`
- Removed `domain_restricted` error block from the login page
- Deleted `lib/constants.ts` (its only export was `ALLOWED_EMAIL_DOMAIN`)
- Removed unused `useSearchParams` / `Suspense` from login page
- Updated `.env.example`, `ARCHITECTURE.md`, `CLAUDE.md`

### Rebrand: Accelerate Synthesis → Synthesiser — 2026-04-02
- Renamed product from "Accelerate Synthesis" to "Synthesiser" across all UI, metadata, and PDF output
- Removed InMobi and ad-tech specific context from all AI prompts (signal extraction, master signal cold start, master signal incremental) — prompts are now industry-agnostic
- Made login page domain restriction error message generic ("Access restricted to authorised email domains") instead of hardcoded "@inmobi.com"
- Updated package name from "accelerate-synthesis" to "synthesiser"
- Updated all documentation (ARCHITECTURE.md, CLAUDE.md, master PRD, section PRDs/TRDs, seed SQL)

### PRD-007 Part 1: Prompt Editor — View Alternate Master Signal Prompt — 2026-03-30
- Added contextual note above the editor on the Master Signal tab explaining which prompt variant is loaded (cold-start or incremental) and when it's used
- Added inline toggle link to switch between cold-start and incremental prompts without leaving the tab
- Both prompt variants are fully editable — save, reset to default, version history, and revert all work on the toggled variant
- Auto-selected prompt (based on app state) shows an "(active)" badge; alternate prompt does not
- Toggle respects the existing dirty-state guard — switching with unsaved changes triggers the discard confirmation dialog
- Toggle resets when switching between top-level tabs (Signal Extraction ↔ Master Signal)
- New state (`isViewingAlternate`) and derived keys (`autoSelectedMasterKey`, `alternateMasterKey`, `displayedMasterKey`, `effectiveKey`) in `prompt-editor-page-content.tsx`

### PRD-006 Part 1 Increments 1.1–1.3: Master Signal Cleanup on Session Deletion — 2026-03-30
- Added `is_tainted` (BOOLEAN, default false) column to `master_signals` table
- When a session with `structured_notes` is soft-deleted, the latest master signal is marked as tainted via `taintLatestMasterSignal()` in `master-signal-service.ts` (best-effort, doesn't fail the deletion)
- `deleteSession()` in `session-service.ts` now selects `structured_notes` and conditionally taints the master signal
- `POST /api/ai/generate-master-signal` checks `isTainted` on the latest master signal — if tainted, forces a cold-start rebuild (all active sessions) instead of incremental merge, purging deleted session data
- `GET /api/master-signal` response now includes `isTainted` flag
- Master Signal page (`/m-signals`) shows a tainted-specific amber banner: "A session with extracted signals was deleted — regenerate to remove its data from the master signal." (takes priority over standard staleness banner; combines both messages when both conditions are true)
- Settings page (`/settings`) prompt editor now resolves the Master Signal tab to the cold-start prompt when the master signal is tainted, since that's the prompt that will be used on the next generation
- `MasterSignal` TypeScript interface updated with `isTainted: boolean` across service, API, and frontend layers

### PRD-005 UX Improvement: Dynamic Master Signal Tab — 2026-03-27
- Consolidated three prompt tabs into two: "Signal Extraction" and "Master Signal"
- The Master Signal tab dynamically resolves to the cold start or incremental prompt by checking `GET /api/master-signal` on mount — if a master signal exists, edits the incremental prompt; otherwise edits the cold start prompt
- Removed the confusing cold start / incremental distinction from the UI; the system selects the correct prompt automatically

### PRD-005 Part 4 Increment 4.2: Version View Dialog + Revert Wiring — 2026-03-27
- Created `version-view-dialog.tsx`: read-only dialog showing full prompt content for any past version, with version number, active badge, author email, relative timestamp in the header, and "Revert to this version" button (hidden for active version)
- Wired "View" button in version history panel to open the dialog with the selected version's content
- Wired "Revert" button in both the history panel and the dialog to POST the old content as a new active version and refetch history
- Dialog closes automatically after a successful revert

### PRD-005 Part 4 Increment 4.1: Version History Panel — 2026-03-27
- Created `format-relative-time.ts` utility for relative timestamps ("just now", "5m ago", "3h ago", "2d ago", or formatted date for older entries)
- Created `version-history-panel.tsx`: collapsible panel below the editor action bar showing all prompt versions newest-first, with computed version numbers (oldest = v1), "Active" badge, author email, relative timestamp, 100-char content preview, and View/Revert buttons
- Modified `prompt-editor-page-content.tsx` to store history from API response, render the panel, toggle open/closed, and handle revert via existing POST endpoint

### PRD-005 Part 3 Increments 3.1–3.2: Prompt Editor UI — 2026-03-27
- Created `prompt-editor.tsx`: monospace textarea component with full-height flex layout, loading skeleton, and spellcheck disabled
- Created `prompt-editor-page-content.tsx`: main client component with tab layout (signal extraction, master signal cold start, master signal incremental), API fetch on tab switch, dirty tracking (originalContent vs currentContent), save handler (POST to /api/prompts), reset-to-default handler (POST hardcoded default), character count, unsaved changes dialog on tab switch, and `beforeunload` guard for browser navigation
- Updated `app/settings/page.tsx` to render `PromptEditorPageContent` for admin users
- Full-width/full-height editor layout using flex column chain from layout → page → tabs → textarea

### PRD-005 Part 2 Increment 2.3: Prompt API Routes — 2026-03-27
- Created `GET /api/prompts?key=<prompt_key>`: returns active prompt and full version history, admin-only (403 for non-admins)
- Created `POST /api/prompts`: saves a new prompt version and makes it active, Zod-validated input, admin-only
- Both routes use `isCurrentUserAdmin()` guard and return appropriate HTTP status codes

### PRD-005 Part 2 Increment 2.2: Prompt Service + AI Service Integration — 2026-03-27
- Created `lib/services/prompt-service.ts` with `getActivePrompt()` (service role client), `getPromptHistory()` (anon client), and `savePromptVersion()` (service role client, atomic deactivate + insert)
- Modified `lib/services/ai-service.ts` to read active prompts from the database with hardcoded fallback — `extractSignals()` reads `signal_extraction`, `synthesiseMasterSignal()` reads `master_signal_cold_start` or `master_signal_incremental`
- Hardcoded prompt constants in `lib/prompts/` retained as fallback defaults

### PRD-005 Part 1 Increments 1.2–1.3: Admin Role System — 2026-03-27
- Created `lib/services/profile-service.ts` with `getCurrentProfile()` and `isCurrentUserAdmin()` (server-side, anon client respecting RLS)
- Created `lib/hooks/use-profile.ts` with `useProfile()` hook for fetching admin flag from the browser client
- Extended `AuthProvider` with `isAdmin` via `useProfile` hook; `isLoading` now includes profile fetch to prevent UI flicker
- Modified `tab-nav.tsx` to conditionally show Settings tab for admin users
- Created `app/settings/page.tsx` with server-side admin gate (access-denied state for non-admins)

### PRD-005 Part 1 Increment 1.1 + Part 2 Increment 2.1: Database Migrations — 2026-03-27
- Created `profiles` table with FK to `auth.users`, `is_admin` flag, RLS (users can read own profile), auto-create trigger on signup, backfill for existing users, initial admin seed
- Created `prompt_versions` table with CHECK constraint on `prompt_key`, `is_active` flag, partial unique index (one active per key), RLS via `SECURITY DEFINER` `is_admin()` function
- Seeded three initial prompt versions (signal extraction, master signal cold start, master signal incremental) from hardcoded defaults

### PRD-004 Part 1 Increment 1.5: PDF Download — 2026-03-26
- Installed `pdf-lib` for client-side PDF generation (no server round-trip needed)
- Implemented `master-signal-pdf.ts` using pdf-lib: parses master signal markdown into headings, paragraphs, bullets, and numbered lists, renders them as a styled A4 PDF with branded header, metadata bar, word wrapping, and automatic page breaks
- "Download PDF" button dynamically imports pdf-lib to avoid bloating the initial bundle, generates the PDF in-browser, and triggers a file download
- PDF includes: indigo-branded title bar, generation timestamp + session count, all markdown sections with proper heading hierarchy, bullet/numbered lists, and horizontal rules

### PRD-004 Part 1 Increment 1.4: Frontend Page + Tab Navigation — 2026-03-26
- Created `/m-signals` page with server component and `MasterSignalPageContent` client component
- Page states: loading spinner, empty (no sessions), empty (ready to generate with session count), has master signal (rendered markdown)
- Staleness banner: amber warning showing count of new/updated sessions since last generation
- Generate button: "Generate Master Signal" (cold start) / "Re-generate" (incremental), Loader2 spinner during generation, disabled during processing
- Download PDF button: initially used browser print-to-PDF, replaced in Increment 1.5 with client-side pdf-lib generation
- Metadata bar below header shows generation timestamp and session count
- Master signal content rendered with `react-markdown` + `remark-gfm` + prose styling
- Error handling: toast on API failure, previous master signal preserved on screen
- Added "Master Signals" tab (BarChart3 icon) to `tab-nav.tsx` at `/m-signals`

### PRD-004 Part 1 Increment 1.3: API Routes — 2026-03-26
- Created `POST /api/ai/generate-master-signal` route: triggers cold start or incremental master signal generation via Claude, persists result, returns unchanged if no new sessions since last generation, maps AI errors to user-friendly HTTP responses
- Created `GET /api/master-signal` route: returns the latest master signal and a staleness count (number of sessions updated since last generation)
- Both routes include auth checks (401 if unauthenticated)
- Failed generation never overwrites a good previous master signal

### PRD-004 Part 1 Increment 1.2: AI Prompt + Synthesis Function — 2026-03-26
- Created `lib/prompts/master-signal-synthesis.ts` with two system prompts: cold start (full synthesis from all sessions) and incremental (merge new sessions into existing master signal), plus a user message builder that formats sessions as labeled blocks
- Added `synthesiseMasterSignal()` to `lib/services/ai-service.ts`: accepts sessions + optional previous master signal, selects the appropriate prompt, returns synthesised markdown
- Refactored `ai-service.ts` to extract shared retry logic into a private `callClaude()` helper — both `extractSignals()` and `synthesiseMasterSignal()` use it, eliminating duplicated retry code
- Master signal uses `max_tokens: 8192` (vs 4096 for individual extraction) to accommodate the larger synthesised output

### PRD-004 Part 1 Increment 1.1: Master Signal Database Table + Service Layer — 2026-03-26
- Created `master_signals` table in Supabase: immutable rows, each generation inserts a new snapshot, latest by `generated_at` is the current one
- RLS: authenticated users can SELECT and INSERT (no UPDATE/DELETE — rows are immutable)
- Index: `master_signals_generated_at_idx` (DESC) for fast "get latest" queries
- Created `lib/services/master-signal-service.ts` with five functions: `getLatestMasterSignal`, `getStaleSessionCount`, `getAllSignalSessions`, `getSignalSessionsSince`, `saveMasterSignal`
- SQL migration script saved at `docs/004-master-signals/001-create-master-signals-table.sql`

### Bug Fix: Session Delete + Client Combobox UX — 2026-03-26
- Fixed soft-delete failing due to RLS `WITH CHECK (deleted_at IS NULL)` blocking updates that set `deleted_at`: `deleteSession()` now uses a service role client to bypass RLS for this server-only admin operation
- Added `createServiceRoleClient()` factory to `lib/supabase/server.ts`
- Revamped `ClientCombobox` from a popover/combobox pattern to a type-to-create-first text input: typing defaults to "create new client", existing matches appear as suggestions below, "Create" option is always listed first when the name doesn't exactly match an existing client
- Removed dependency on `cmdk` Command/Popover components from the client combobox (now uses a plain input with a custom dropdown)

### PRD-003 Part 4: Past Sessions — Side-by-Side View with Signal Extraction — 2026-03-26
- Restructured expanded rows in `PastSessionsTable` with a two-column CSS grid layout (`grid-cols-1 md:grid-cols-2`)
- Left column: raw notes displayed in a read-only-by-default `MarkdownPanel` (rendered markdown with edit toggle)
- Right column: structured notes panel with Extract Signals / Re-extract button, empty state, loading spinner, and `MarkdownPanel` for viewing/editing extracted signals
- Added Sparkles icon indicator on collapsed rows for sessions that have structured notes (enriched sessions)
- Signal extraction in expanded rows mirrors the capture form: calls `POST /api/ai/extract-signals`, icon progression (Sparkles → Loader2 → RefreshCw), re-extraction confirmation dialog when structured notes have been edited
- Updated dirty tracking to include `structuredNotes` comparison against the original session value
- Save payload from expanded rows now includes `structuredNotes` (preserves existing value if unchanged, sends updated value if modified or newly extracted)
- Replaced raw `Textarea` import with `MarkdownPanel` for both raw notes and structured notes display

### PRD-003 Part 3: Capture Form — Extract Signals UX — 2026-03-26
- Added `react-markdown`, `remark-gfm`, and `@tailwindcss/typography` dependencies for markdown rendering
- Configured `@tailwindcss/typography` plugin via `@plugin` directive in `globals.css`
- Created `MarkdownPanel` component (`markdown-panel.tsx`) — reusable view/edit panel with rendered markdown preview (prose styling) and raw markdown textarea edit mode, toggled via Eye/Pencil icons
- Added "Extract Signals" button to `SessionCaptureForm` with icon progression: Sparkles (idle) → Loader2 spinner (extracting) → RefreshCw (re-extract)
- Extraction calls `POST /api/ai/extract-signals`, displays structured output in a `MarkdownPanel` below the notes field
- Structured notes are editable in the panel — users can reword, add, or remove signals before saving
- Re-extraction with dirty (edited) structured notes shows a confirmation dialog before overwriting
- Save payload now includes `structuredNotes` (null if not extracted); extraction state resets on successful save
- Signal extraction is optional — sessions can be saved with only raw notes

### PRD-003 Part 2: Signal Extraction via Claude API — 2026-03-26
- Added `POST /api/ai/extract-signals` endpoint that accepts raw session notes and returns a structured markdown signal report via Claude
- Created `lib/prompts/signal-extraction.ts` with the system prompt defining all signal categories (Pain Points, Must-Haves, Aspirations, Competitive Mentions, Blockers, Platforms & Channels, Current Stack, Other/Uncategorised) plus session-level attributes (Summary, Sentiment, Urgency, Decision Timeline) and Client Profile
- Created `lib/services/ai-service.ts` with `extractSignals()` function, exponential backoff retry (up to 3 retries for 429/500/timeout), and typed error classes (`AIServiceError`, `AIEmptyResponseError`, `AIRequestError`, `AIConfigError`)
- Route validates auth (401), input via Zod (400), and maps AI errors to user-friendly HTTP responses (400/422/500/503)

### PRD-003 Part 1: Database Schema Update for Signal Extraction — 2026-03-26
- Added `structured_notes` (TEXT, nullable) column to `sessions` table for storing markdown-formatted signal extraction output
- Updated `GET /api/sessions` response to include `structured_notes` field
- Updated `POST /api/sessions` and `PUT /api/sessions/[id]` to accept optional `structuredNotes` in request body
- PUT supports "omit = preserve" semantics: omitting `structuredNotes` preserves existing value, sending `null` clears it
- Updated service layer interfaces (`Session`, `CreateSessionInput`, `UpdateSessionInput`) and query functions

### PRD-002 Part 3 Increment 3.4: Expandable Rows with Inline Editing — 2026-03-25
- Added expandable row inline editing to `PastSessionsTable`: click a row to expand it with editable client combobox, date picker, and textarea pre-populated with session data
- Added Save, Cancel, and Delete actions in expanded rows: Save calls `PUT /api/sessions/[id]`, Delete shows inline confirmation then calls `DELETE /api/sessions/[id]`
- Added dirty state tracking: compares current form values to original session snapshot
- Created `UnsavedChangesDialog` component: Save/Discard/Cancel prompt when switching rows with unsaved changes (P3.R9)
- Moved expand/collapse state management fully into `PastSessionsTable` (simplified `CapturePageContent`)
- Delete confirmation uses inline confirm/cancel buttons (no modal) for faster interaction

### PRD-002 Part 3 Increment 3.3: Past Sessions Table UI — 2026-03-25
- Created `ClientFilterCombobox` component: searches clients with `hasSession=true`, no "create new" option, includes clear button
- Created `SessionFilters` component: horizontal filter bar with client combobox and date range pickers (From/To), individual clear buttons, date auto-sync (From adjusts To if past it, and vice versa)
- Created `PastSessionsTable` component: fetches sessions with server-side filters and offset-based pagination, "Load more" button, empty state
- Created `CapturePageContent` client wrapper: manages `refreshKey` between form and table
- Updated `SessionCaptureForm` to accept `onSessionSaved` callback prop
- Updated `DatePicker` to accept optional `min`/`max` props

### PRD-002 Part 3 Increment 3.2: Session Update and Delete API — 2026-03-25
- Added `updateSession()` and `deleteSession()` to `session-service.ts`: update supports client change (including new client creation), delete sets `deleted_at`
- Created `PUT /api/sessions/[id]` route handler: Zod validation, handles 404/409 errors
- Created `DELETE /api/sessions/[id]` route handler: soft-delete with 404 handling

### PRD-002 Part 3 Increment 3.1: Session List API and Service — 2026-03-25
- Added `getSessions()` to `session-service.ts`: joins sessions with clients, supports clientId/dateFrom/dateTo filters, offset-based pagination with total count
- Added `GET /api/sessions` route handler: Zod-validated query params, returns `{ sessions, total }`
- Extended `searchClients()` with optional `hasSession` filter: queries distinct client_ids from sessions table
- Updated `GET /api/clients` route handler to support `hasSession=true` query param

### PRD-002 Part 2 Increment 2.2: Session Capture Form and Page Update — 2026-03-25
- Created `DatePicker` component (`app/capture/_components/date-picker.tsx`): styled native date input, future dates blocked via `max` attribute
- Created `SessionCaptureForm` component (`app/capture/_components/session-capture-form.tsx`): react-hook-form + zod, three fields (client combobox, date picker, notes textarea), disabled-until-valid submit, toast on success/failure, form reset on save
- Replaced capture page placeholder with the real `SessionCaptureForm`
- Added `Toaster` from sonner to root layout for toast notifications

### PRD-002 Part 2 Increment 2.1: Session Service and API Route — 2026-03-25
- Created `session-service.ts` (`lib/services/session-service.ts`): orchestrates client creation (if new) and session insertion in a single flow
- Created `POST /api/sessions` route handler: Zod validation with conditional `clientName` requirement via `refine()`, 201 on success, 409 for duplicate clients, 400 for validation errors

### PRD-002 Part 1 Increment 1.3: Client Combobox Component — 2026-03-25
- Created `command.tsx` and `popover.tsx` shadcn/ui primitives (cmdk + radix popover)
- Created `ClientCombobox` component (`app/capture/_components/client-combobox.tsx`): debounced search (300ms), keyboard navigation, "Create new client" option with inline confirmation text
- Installed `cmdk` package

### PRD-002 Part 1 Increment 1.2: Client API Routes and Service — 2026-03-25
- Created `client-service.ts` (`lib/services/client-service.ts`): `searchClients()` with case-insensitive partial match, `createNewClient()` with duplicate detection via `ClientDuplicateError`
- Created `GET /api/clients` route handler: search by query param `q`, returns up to 50 matches
- Created `POST /api/clients` route handler: Zod validation, 201 on success, 409 on duplicate name

### PRD-002 Part 1 Increment 1.1: Database Schema — 2026-03-25
- Created `clients` table: UUID PK, name (case-insensitive unique), timestamps, soft delete
- Created `sessions` table: UUID PK, FK to clients, session_date, raw_notes, created_by (auth.uid()), timestamps, soft delete
- Added RLS policies on both tables (authenticated users only, soft-delete filtering on SELECT)
- Created `update_updated_at()` shared trigger function for both tables
- Added indexes: `clients_name_unique`, `sessions_client_id_idx`, `sessions_session_date_idx`

### PRD-001 Part 2 Increment 2.2: Middleware, AuthProvider, and User Menu — 2026-03-25
- Created route protection middleware (`middleware.ts`): redirects unauthenticated users to `/login`, refreshes sessions via `getUser()`, redirects authenticated users away from `/login`
- Created `AuthProvider` context (`components/providers/auth-provider.tsx`): exposes `user`, `isAuthenticated`, `isLoading`, `signOut` via React context with `onAuthStateChange` subscription
- Wrapped root layout with `AuthProvider`
- Wired `UserMenu` to auth context: loading skeleton, sign-in link when unauthenticated, Google avatar + email + sign-out dropdown when authenticated
- Added `lh3.googleusercontent.com` to `next.config.ts` image remote patterns for Google avatars

### PRD-001 Part 2 Increment 2.1: Supabase Clients, Login Page, OAuth Callback — 2026-03-25
- Created server-side Supabase client factory (`lib/supabase/server.ts`) using `@supabase/ssr` with cookie helpers
