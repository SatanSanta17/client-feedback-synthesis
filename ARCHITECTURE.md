# Synthesiser — Architecture

> **This document reflects what is actually built — not what is planned.** It is the source of truth for the current state of the system. It is updated *after* every change that modifies file structure, routes, services, database tables, or environment variables. Read this before making any changes.

> For planned features and requirements, see the PRD and TRD in `docs/`.

## Overview

Synthesiser is a web application for teams to capture structured client session notes and view a live synthesis dashboard of cross-client themes, signal strength, and roadmap gaps.

**Tech Stack:**
- Frontend & API: Next.js (App Router, TypeScript)
- Database: Supabase (PostgreSQL + Row-Level Security)
- Authentication: Google OAuth via Supabase Auth
- AI: Vercel AI SDK (server-side only) — supports Anthropic, OpenAI, Google via env-var-driven provider selection
- Hosting: Vercel
- Styling: Tailwind CSS + shadcn/ui

## Current State

**Status:** PRD-002 through PRD-010 implemented. PRD-011 (Email + Password Auth, Parts 1–4) implemented. PRD-012 Parts 1–5 (Design Tokens and Typography + DRY Extraction + SRP Component Decomposition + API Route/Service Cleanup + Dependency Inversion) implemented. PRD-013 Parts 1–4 (File Upload Infrastructure + Persistence & Signal Extraction Integration + Past Sessions Attachment Management + Edge Cases & Limits) implemented. PRD-014 Parts 1–4 (Session Traceability & Staleness Data Model + View Prompt on Capture Page + Show Prompt Version in Past Sessions + Staleness Indicators & Re-extraction Warnings) implemented. PRD-015 Part 1 (Public Landing Page) implemented. PRD-016 (Dark Mode) and PRD-017 (Bulk Re-extraction) implemented. PRD-018 Parts 1–2 (Structured Output Migration + Render UI from JSON) implemented. PRD-019 Parts 1–4 (pgvector Setup & Embeddings Table + Chunking Logic + Embedding Pipeline + Retrieval Service) implemented. PRD-020 Parts 1–3 (Sidebar Navigation + Chat Data Model and Streaming Infrastructure + Chat UI Components) implemented. PRD-021 Parts 1–6 (Theme Assignment at Extraction Time + Dashboard Layout, Navigation, and Direct Widgets + Derived Theme Widgets + Qualitative Drill-Down + AI-Generated Headline Insights + Filters and Interactivity) implemented. PRD-022 Parts 1–4 (Settings Accordion + Team Management Page + Extraction Prompt Page + Landing Page Refresh) implemented. PRD-023 Parts 1–3 (Codebase Cleanup: Quick Wins + Shared Route Helpers + Session Orchestrator) implemented — auth boilerplate, file-upload validation, and the `profiles.can_create_team` query are extracted into `lib/api/` helpers and `team-service.ts`; the post-response embeddings → themes → insights chain on session create / re-extract is owned by `runSessionPostResponseChain` in `lib/services/session-orchestrator.ts` (routes still register it via `after()`). The app is a fully functional team-capable client feedback capture and synthesis platform with a public landing page, vector search infrastructure, Instagram-style hover-to-expand sidebar navigation, complete RAG chat interface (conversations sidebar, message thread with virtualized scrolling, streaming with markdown, citations, follow-ups, in-conversation search, archive read-only mode), and full server-side RAG chat infrastructure (conversations, messages, tool-augmented streaming, LLM title generation). Dual authentication (Google OAuth and email/password with recovery flow), working capture form with AI signal extraction and file attachment upload with server-side persistence, past sessions table with filters/inline editing/soft delete, prompt editor with version history (at `/settings/prompts`), dedicated team management (at `/settings/team`), role-based team access, automatic embedding generation on session save/extraction, and semantic retrieval service with adaptive query classification for downstream RAG and insights features. **Note:** the master-signal backend (API route, service, repository, prompt, `master_signals` table) remains wired but the `/m-signals` UI page has been retired — see "Master Signal (retained backend, retired UI)" below.

**Core features live:**
- Public landing page at `/` with hero, feature cards, how-it-works flow, and CTA (authenticated users auto-redirect to `/dashboard`; new accounts with no sessions redirect to `/capture`)
- Dual authentication: Google OAuth and email + password (sign-up, sign-in, forgot-password, reset-password) via Supabase Auth; invite acceptance supports both paths
- Session capture with AI signal extraction (Vercel AI SDK, multi-provider) and file attachment upload (TXT, PDF, CSV, DOCX, JSON) with server-side parsing and chat format detection (WhatsApp, Slack)
- Per-user/per-team prompt editor with version history and revert, accessed at `/settings/prompts`
- Team workspaces with role-based access (owner, admin, sales)
- Email invitations via provider-agnostic email service (Resend)
- Workspace switcher (personal ↔ team contexts)
- Team-scoped sessions, clients, master signals, and prompts
- Team management (members, roles, ownership transfer, rename, delete)
- Data retention on member departure
- RAG chat interface at `/chat` — conversation sidebar (search, pin, archive, rename, delete), virtualized message thread, markdown rendering with citations, follow-up suggestions, in-conversation search with match navigation, starter questions, archive read-only with unarchive
- AI-powered theme assignment — automatic topic-based classification of signal chunks during extraction, chained after embedding generation (fire-and-forget), workspace-scoped themes with many-to-many signal-theme junction, primary/secondary themes with confidence scores
- AI-powered insights dashboard at `/dashboard` — sentiment distribution (donut chart), urgency distribution (bar chart), session volume over time (area chart with week/month toggle), client health grid (scatter plot), competitive mentions (horizontal bar chart), top themes (horizontal bar chart with chunk-type breakdown tooltip), theme trends (multi-line chart with local theme selector and granularity toggle), theme-client matrix (heatmap grid with intensity-mapped cells); global filter bar (client multi-select, date range, severity, urgency) with URL-encoded state; `confidenceMin` available as URL param for theme query filtering; all widgets consume a shared `queryDatabase` service layer via `/api/dashboard` route; qualitative drill-down — clicking any widget data point opens a sliding Sheet panel showing actual signal texts grouped by client in collapsible accordion, with chunk-type/theme badges, session date, and "View Session" button that opens a Dialog with the full StructuredSignalView; two-layer architecture (DrillDownContent + DrillDownPanel) for swappable presentation shell; AI-generated headline insights — 3–5 classified insight cards (trend/anomaly/milestone) with type-specific colour accents displayed above the widget grid, manual "Refresh Insights" button, automatic generation after session extraction via fire-and-forget chain, collapsible "Previous Insights" section with lazy-loaded historical batches; cross-widget filtering — shift+click on sentiment/urgency/client data points sets global URL filters that all widgets respond to; data freshness indicator — "Data as of [time]" display updated via FreshnessContext from all widget fetches; dashboard screenshot export — "Export as Image" button dynamically imports html2canvas, prepends temporary filter context header, captures at 2x retina scale, triggers PNG download with date-stamped filename

**Database tables:** `clients`, `sessions`, `session_attachments`, `session_embeddings`, `themes`, `signal_themes`, `master_signals`, `profiles`, `prompt_versions`, `teams`, `team_members`, `team_invitations`, `conversations`, `messages`, `dashboard_insights` — all with RLS. **RPC functions:** `match_session_embeddings` (vector similarity search), `sessions_over_time` (time-bucketed session counts by week/month for dashboard).

## Data Model

### `clients`

Stores known client names for autocomplete and cross-session querying. Scoped to a user (personal workspace) or a team.

| Column | Type | Notes |
|--------|------|-------|
| `id` | UUID (PK) | `gen_random_uuid()` |
| `name` | TEXT | Unique per user or team (case-insensitive) among non-deleted rows |
| `created_by` | UUID | NOT NULL, default `auth.uid()` — owning user |

## Authentication Flow

**Providers:** Supabase Auth with two paths — Google OAuth and email + password. Open to any account (no domain allowlist). Email confirmation is required for new email/password sign-ups.

**Middleware** (`middleware.ts`) runs on every request. It refreshes the Supabase session via `getUser()`, redirects unauthenticated users to `/login`, and validates the `active_team_id` cookie (clears if user is no longer a member). Public routes (`/`, `/login`, `/signup`, `/forgot-password`, `/auth/callback`, `/invite/*`) are excluded. Authenticated users who hit `/login`, `/signup`, or `/forgot-password` are bounced to `DEFAULT_AUTH_ROUTE` (`/dashboard`). `/reset-password` is not public — users arrive there via the recovery link which establishes a session first.

**Google OAuth flow:**

1. User visits `/login` or `/signup` and clicks "Continue with Google."
2. `supabase.auth.signInWithOAuth({ provider: 'google' })` redirects to the Google consent screen.
3. Google redirects back to `/auth/callback?code=...`.
4. The callback route handler exchanges the code for a session via `supabase.auth.exchangeCodeForSession(code)`.
5. On success: the callback checks `sessions` count for the user — redirects to `DEFAULT_AUTH_ROUTE` (`/dashboard`) for returning users and `ONBOARDING_ROUTE` (`/capture`) for accounts with no sessions. Both constants live in `lib/constants.ts`. On failure: redirect to `/login?error=exchange_failed`.

**Email + password flow:**

1. **Sign-up** (`/signup`): user submits email + password (`passwordField` Zod schema: 8+ chars, 1 digit, 1 special char). Supabase sends a confirmation email; UI shows `EmailConfirmationPanel` until confirmed.
2. **Sign-in** (`/login`): same page hosts email/password and Google OAuth. Email/password sign-in establishes a session directly; the form then calls `router.push(DEFAULT_AUTH_ROUTE)` (or `ONBOARDING_ROUTE` for first-run accounts).
3. **Forgot password** (`/forgot-password`): `supabase.auth.resetPasswordForEmail()` with `redirectTo=...?type=recovery`. Email triggers the recovery link.
4. **Reset password** (`/reset-password`): the auth callback recognises `type=recovery` and redirects here; the form calls `supabase.auth.updateUser({ password })` to commit the new password.

**Shared auth context:**

- **AuthProvider** (`components/providers/auth-provider.tsx`) wraps the app in `layout.tsx`. It reads the initial session on mount, subscribes to `onAuthStateChange`, and exposes `user`, `isAuthenticated`, `isLoading`, `canCreateTeam`, `activeTeamId`, `setActiveTeam`, and `signOut` via React context. `signOut()` calls `supabase.auth.signOut()`, `clearActiveTeamCookie()`, and `clearAllStreams()` (PRD-024) so workspace context, streaming state, and the user identity don't leak to the next session on the same machine. The `onAuthStateChange` listener mirrors the same cleanup on any session-null transition (token expiry, multi-tab sign-out, server-side revoke) — not just the explicit `signOut` path (PRD-024 P5.R4).
- **UserMenu** consumes the auth context. Shows a loading skeleton while `isLoading`, a "Sign in" link when unauthenticated, and the user's avatar + email with a sign-out dropdown when authenticated.

**Invite acceptance flow:**

1. User receives an email with a link to `/invite/[token]`.
2. If authenticated and email matches the invitation: `InviteAcceptCard` shows team name, role, and "Accept & Join Team" button. Accepting calls `POST /api/invite/[token]/accept`, which creates a `team_members` entry and sets `active_team_id` cookie.
3. If authenticated but email does NOT match: `InviteMismatchCard` warns the user and offers a sign-out option.
4. If unauthenticated + account already exists for the invited email: `InviteSignInForm` — email is pre-filled; password or Google OAuth completes sign-in. A `pending_invite_token` cookie is set before any OAuth redirect.
5. If unauthenticated + no account exists: `InviteSignUpForm` — email is pre-filled; completing sign-up flows through confirmation.
6. After OAuth callback, if `pending_invite_token` exists and the signed-in email matches the invitation email, the callback auto-accepts the invitation, sets `active_team_id`, and clears the pending token cookie. On email mismatch the callback redirects to `/invite/[token]?error=email_mismatch`.

**Workspace context:**

- The `active_team_id` cookie determines the current workspace (personal or team). Absence = personal workspace.
- The **AuthProvider** exposes `activeTeamId` and `setActiveTeam()` via React context. `setActiveTeam` writes the cookie and updates context state, triggering reactive re-renders in all consuming components — no page reload needed.
- The **WorkspaceSwitcher** and **CreateTeamDialog** call `setActiveTeam()` to switch workspaces. Client-side cookie helpers live in `lib/cookies/active-team.ts`.
- Route handlers read the active team ID via `getActiveTeamId()` from `lib/cookies/active-team-server.ts`, then pass it to repository factories. Services receive pre-scoped repositories — they never call `getActiveTeamId()` directly.

## Key Design Decisions

1. **Standalone app.** Separate deployment, separate auth, separate database. No shared components.
2. **Supabase for auth and database.** Provides Google OAuth, PostgreSQL, RLS, and auto-generated types out of the box. Reduces infrastructure overhead.
3. **Server-side AI calls only, provider-agnostic.** API keys never touch the browser. All AI operations go through Next.js API routes. The AI service exposes two public generics — `callModelText()` and `callModelObject<T>()` — that wrap provider resolution, retry logic, and error classification. All non-streaming LLM calls (extraction, synthesis, title generation, theme assignment) use these generics. Streaming chat uses `streamText()` directly. Supports multiple providers (Anthropic, OpenAI, Google) via `AI_PROVIDER` and `AI_MODEL` env vars.
4. **AI-driven theme assignment at extraction time.** Signal chunks are automatically classified into topic-based themes during extraction via a chained fire-and-forget LLM call (PRD-021). The LLM strongly prefers existing themes over creating new ones; the database enforces uniqueness via case-insensitive partial indexes. Each chunk can have multiple themes (primary + secondary) with confidence scores. Manual theme management is deferred to backlog.
5. **Clients as a first-class entity.** Separate `clients` table (not derived from unique session values) to support future enrichment and enterprise features.
6. **Architecture follows code, not the other way around.** This document is updated after implementation, never speculatively. If it's in this file, it exists in the codebase.
7. **AI prompts are DB-first with hardcoded fallback.** Active prompts are read from `prompt_versions` at runtime. If the DB is unreachable, the AI service falls back to the hardcoded constants in `lib/prompts/`.
8. **Team workspaces with personal fallback.** Users operate in either a personal workspace (no team) or a team workspace. The `active_team_id` cookie determines context. All data tables have a nullable `team_id` column — NULL means personal workspace. Data services read the active team ID and scope queries accordingly.
9. **Role-based access within teams.** Three roles: owner (one per team, full control), admin (manage members and content), sales (capture sessions, view data). Owner is a database concept (`teams.owner_id`), not a role value — the owner always has `role = 'admin'` in `team_members`.
10. **Team creation is a paid feature.** The `can_create_team` flag on `profiles` gates team creation. Developers enable this per user. No self-service payment gateway. **Beta override (current):** the column default is set to `true` and all existing profiles are backfilled so every user can create teams during beta testing. The gating machinery in `POST /api/teams` and `workspace-switcher.tsx` is intact — reverting is a single migration (`ALTER COLUMN ... SET DEFAULT false` + selective backfill) with no code change.
11. **Data retention on member departure.** When a member is removed or leaves, their sessions and other data remain in the team (owned by `team_id`). The `team_members.removed_at` timestamp records the departure. Re-inviting a departed member restores full access.
12. **Provider-agnostic email service.** Email sending is abstracted via `email-service.ts` with `resolveEmailProvider()` — supports Resend and Brevo, extensible to SMTP and others via `EMAIL_PROVIDER` env var.
13. **Dependency Inversion via repository pattern.** All 8 data-access services accept injected repository interfaces instead of importing Supabase directly. Repository interfaces live in `lib/repositories/`, Supabase adapters in `lib/repositories/supabase/`, and an in-memory mock in `lib/repositories/mock/`. Route handlers create Supabase clients, instantiate repositories via factory functions (`createSessionRepository`, etc.), and pass them to services. Services have zero coupling to Supabase — the `lib/services/` directory contains no `@/lib/supabase/server` imports. Workspace scoping (`team_id` filtering) is centralised in a shared `scopeByTeam()` helper within the adapter layer.
14. **Chat data isolation: anon client for reads, service-role for embeddings.** The RAG chat system uses two Supabase clients: the RLS-protected anon client for all data reads (via the `queryDatabase` tool), ensuring row-level security enforces both team scoping and personal workspace isolation (`created_by = auth.uid()`); and the service-role client only for the embedding repository (similarity search RPC). The embedding RPC adds explicit `filter_user_id` scoping for personal workspace queries. `teamId` is always resolved server-side from the `active_team_id` cookie — never accepted from the client request body. The chat tool's action enum and LLM-facing description are derived from the `ACTION_METADATA` registry in `lib/services/database-query/action-metadata.ts` — the single source of truth for which `QueryAction` values the LLM may invoke and what each does. Adding a new entry to `QueryAction` produces a TypeScript error in the registry until classified, structurally preventing drift between the chat tool's exposed surface and the service's actual capabilities. The chat tool's filter input mirrors the dashboard's filter dimensions (`severity`, `urgency`, `granularity`, `clientIds`, `confidenceMin`); `severity` is a per-chunk field in `structured_json` (painPoints/requirements/aspirations/blockers/custom.signals) and is honored via post-filter on session rows or via pre-resolved session-ID constraints on theme joins. (Gap E4)
**Identifier ownership for chat (Gaps E14 + E15 + P9).** Client owns the conversation UUID and the user message UUID end-to-end. `useChat.sendMessage` generates `userMessageId` via `crypto.randomUUID()` before the optimistic render and, when there's no active conversation, also generates the conversation UUID inline at the moment of first send (gap P9 — UUID materialises with the conversation, not at component mount). Both UUIDs are sent in the POST body. The server idempotently creates the conversations row on first POST (`getOrCreateConversation`) and inserts the user message with the explicit primary key. Server owns the assistant message UUID and surfaces it via the `X-Assistant-Message-Id` response header at fetch-response time, so the client has it during streaming (used by the cancel path to attach a real ID to cancelled bubbles instead of a temp ID). The `X-Conversation-Id` header is informational — the client already knows the id it just generated. Stream finalization paths (success / error / abort) all update the same placeholder row with `status` + accumulated partial content — abort flips to `cancelled`, error flips to `failed`, both preserve `fullText`. `request.signal` is propagated through to `streamText({ abortSignal })` so client cancels also cancel the upstream provider call. Duplicate inserts on idempotent retries: messages → 409 via `MessageDuplicateError`; conversations → reuse the existing row via `getOrCreateConversation`'s unique-violation fallback (cross-user UUID collisions surface as `ConversationNotAccessibleError` → 404 because RLS hides the row).

**Conversation routing (Gap P9).** The chat is a single persistent client component (`ChatPageContent`); in-app navigation never traverses Next.js's page boundary, so the shell never remounts. `activeConversationId: string | null` — `null` means fresh chat (URL `/chat`, no DB row, no messages). The two route files (`app/chat/page.tsx` and `app/chat/[id]/page.tsx`) exist solely to seed `initialConversationId` on first arrival, hard refresh, deep-link, or share — they do not participate in subsequent navigation. All in-session URL changes use raw `window.history` API: `pushState` for sidebar clicks, "New chat", and the silent first-send URL update fired from `useChat.onConversationCreated` after `X-Conversation-Id` arrives. `pushState` (not `replaceState`) preserves the natural browser history chain — back from `/chat/<id>` returns to `/chat` (empty fresh chat) before exiting the chat surface. Browser back/forward sync via a `popstate` listener that atomically calls `clearMessages()` + `setActiveConversationId(parsed)` in the same handler so React batches both state updates into one render commit (no flash of stale messages). Sidebar items are `<div role="button" onClick={onSelect}>` (NOT `<Link>`/router.push) — the row contains a `<DropdownMenuTrigger>` which is itself a real `<button>`, so nesting a button is invalid HTML; the WAI-ARIA "button role on non-button element" pattern is used with full keyboard-activation handling. Cross-user / non-existent UUIDs at `/chat/<id>` surface a "Conversation not found" panel (via `useChat.isConversationNotFound`, set when the messages-list fetch returns 404) with a "Start a new chat" CTA wired to the same `navigateToFreshChat` primitive the sidebar uses. The `useChat` load-messages effect uses a `prevConversationIdRef` + `messagesRef` discriminator to skip re-fetching on the `null → just-created` transition fired by `onConversationCreated` (messages already populated by the streaming flow). `ChatArea`'s empty-state branch is gated on `activeConversationId === null` (the raw id from the parent), NOT `activeConversation === null` (the looked-up sidebar entry) — during the conversations-list fetch window after a fresh mount of `app/chat/[id]/page.tsx` the lookup briefly returns null while the id is already set, and using the raw id prevents flashing the "Start a new conversation" starter panel during that window.
15. **Dashboard widgets are self-contained client components.** Each widget owns its own fetch lifecycle via the shared `useDashboardFetch` hook, reading global filter state from URL search params (bookmarkable/shareable). The `/api/dashboard` route validates action + filter params with Zod and delegates to `executeQuery()` using the anon Supabase client (RLS-protected). Chart colours and chunk-type labels are centralised in `chart-colours.ts` to avoid duplication. Recharts is the charting library for most widgets; the theme-client matrix uses an HTML grid for heatmap rendering (PRD-021 Parts 2–3). Theme query handlers share `fetchActiveThemeMap()` and `fetchSignalThemeRows()` to DRY the multi-table join chain (`signal_themes` → `session_embeddings` → `sessions`). The `confidenceMin` URL param filters theme assignments by confidence score (forward-compatible for Part 6 UI slider). Qualitative drill-down (PRD-021 Part 4) uses a two-layer architecture: `DrillDownContent` is a presentation-agnostic `<div>` owning data fetching, client accordion, and signal rows; `DrillDownPanel` is a thin `Sheet` shell (swappable to `Dialog` in one file change). All 7 clickable widgets pass a `DrillDownContext` discriminated union via `onDrillDown` callback to the coordinator (`dashboard-content.tsx`). The drill-down API action uses Zod validation on the JSON payload and dispatches to 7 internal query strategies (3 direct + 1 competitor + 3 theme), capping results at 100 signals. A separate `session_detail` action fetches a single session for the `SessionPreviewDialog`.
16. **AI-generated headline insights as a chained extraction side-effect.** Three to five classified insight cards (`trend`/`anomaly`/`milestone`) sit above the dashboard widget grid. Generation aggregates five dashboard queries in parallel via `executeQuery()`, fetches the previous batch for change-focused framing, and calls `callModelObject()` with `headlineInsightsResponseSchema`. Writes are batched (one `batch_id` per generation) to `dashboard_insights` via the service-role client. Two trigger paths: manual "Refresh Insights" button (`POST /api/dashboard/insights`) and the post-extraction fire-and-forget chain (`generateSessionEmbeddings → assignSessionThemes → maybeRefreshDashboardInsights`), which uses a staleness check (new-session count since last generation) to avoid regenerating on every save. Previous batches are lazy-loaded via `PreviousInsights`.
17. **Master Signal (retained backend, retired UI).** The master-signal page (`/m-signals`) has been removed from the navigation and deleted from the codebase, but the full backend remains wired: `master_signals` table, `master-signal-service.ts` (`generateOrUpdateMasterSignal`, cold-start vs incremental), `master-signal-repository.ts` (+ Supabase adapter), `master-signal-synthesis.ts` prompt, `GET /api/master-signal`, `POST /api/ai/generate-master-signal`, `is_tainted` taint propagation on session delete, and prompt variants under `prompt_versions.prompt_key` (`master_signal_cold_start`, `master_signal_incremental`). Rationale: the feature is deprecated in the UX direction (dashboards + chat replaced it), but the backend is retained as an optional re-entry point and to preserve historical data. Do not reference it in user-facing copy; do not delete it without a cleanup PRD that also migrates/archives the table.
18. **Filter persistence across surfaces.** Every filtered surface (dashboard, capture past-sessions, and any future equivalent) persists filter state via the shared `useFilterStorage` hook (`lib/hooks/use-filter-storage.ts`). Keys are `filters:<surface>:<userId>:<workspaceId ?? "personal">`. `userId` isolates users on shared tabs; `workspaceId` gives per-workspace memory. Browser tab close wipes sessionStorage; no explicit cleanup on signOut is required because stale keys from a prior user are inert (different `userId` segment). Workspace switches call `router.replace(pathname)` inside `setActiveTeam()` to strip URL query params — preventing workspace A's URL filters from applying to workspace B's data — after which each surface's mount/key-change effects hydrate from the new workspace's storage entry (URL-based surfaces re-populate the URL; state-based surfaces hydrate React state). URL remains the source of truth for rendering and sharing wherever it's used; storage is purely a rehydration layer. Dashboard (`filter-bar.tsx`) is URL-based; capture past-sessions (`past-sessions-table.tsx`) is React-state-based — the hook is intentionally a narrow primitive (`read`/`write`/`key`) so each surface wires its own sync policy.
19. **Post-response background chain via `after()` + `maxDuration = 60`.** The embeddings → themes → insights chain on session create (`POST /api/sessions`) and re-extract (`PUT /api/sessions/[id]`) lives in `runSessionPostResponseChain` (`lib/services/session-orchestrator.ts`) — owns sessionMeta construction, chunk selection, chain-repo creation, the three stage calls, per-stage timing logs, and the unconditional error log. Routes register it inside `after()` from `next/server` so Vercel keeps the function instance alive past the JSON response until the chain resolves; `export const maxDuration = 60` (declared in each route file because Next.js requires the literal there) raises the Hobby-tier hard ceiling from the 10s default. The user-perceived latency is unchanged (response is sent immediately after the DB insert). Per-stage timing logs (`chain timing — embeddings/themes/insights`) and the unconditional error log (with sessionId + elapsedMs + stack) are emitted on every run; the route's existing log prefix (`[POST /api/sessions]` or `[PUT /api/sessions/[id]]`) is passed as `logPrefix` so production grep patterns and dashboards continue to match (PRD-023 P3.R2). **Migration trigger:** when p95 chain duration approaches the 60s ceiling — or any stage's failure rate becomes non-trivial — move the chain off the request lifecycle entirely (queue worker: Inngest, QStash, or Supabase queues) for retries, replay, and unbounded execution time. The orchestrator's input contract (`SessionPostResponseChainInput`) is the migration boundary: a queue-job handler would re-create `serviceClient` from job context and call `runSessionPostResponseChain` unchanged. Until then, `after()` + `maxDuration` is the deliberate floor; the timing logs are the signal that determines when to escalate. See `gap-analysis.md` E2 and the corresponding TRD section.

20. **Route-handler auth layer (PRD-023 Part 2).** Auth + team/session role checks + canonical responses live in `lib/api/`. `requireAuth()` returns `AuthContext` (user + supabase + serviceClient) or a 401 NextResponse. `requireTeamMember/Admin/Owner(teamId, user, forbiddenMessage?)` extends it with `team`, `member`, `teamRepo` and enforces role hierarchy: member = membership exists; admin = `member.role === "admin"`; owner = `team.owner_id === user.id`. Owner is orthogonal to `team_members.role` (always also `admin` per `team-repository.create()`), so admin-level routes transparently allow owners. `requireSessionAccess(sessionId, user)` wraps the framework-agnostic `checkSessionAccess` from `session-service.ts` and translates the result via `lib/utils/map-access-error.ts`. Helpers return `T | NextResponse`; callers short-circuit via `if (result instanceof NextResponse) return result`. Helpers don't log — routes preserve their own entry/exit/error logs and helper logs would duplicate them. `idempotentNoOp(message)` (in `lib/api/idempotent-no-op.ts`) is the canonical 409 for "no-op: state already matches" (used by the role-update route's "already has role X" branch). `validateFileUpload(file)` (in `lib/api/file-validation.ts`) enforces per-file size + MIME constraints shared by `/api/sessions/[id]/attachments` POST and `/api/files/parse` POST; per-session caps (`MAX_ATTACHMENTS`) stay in routes as a collection-level concern. `canUserCreateTeam(profileRepo, userId)` in `team-service.ts` replaces the inline `profiles.can_create_team` query and returns a discriminated union (`{ allowed: true } | { allowed: false; reason: "profile_not_found" | "feature_disabled" }`); routes own HTTP framing. Server-side `getActiveTeamId()` lives in `lib/cookies/active-team-server.ts` (paired with the existing client-side `lib/cookies/active-team.ts`); `lib/supabase/server.ts` is now exclusively Supabase client factories.
